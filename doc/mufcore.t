@cindex Flowers, let a thousand bloom
@cindex Wine, dilution of
@cindex Sophistication
@cindex Prim

Muq is designed to be a highly extendable framework from
which more specialized servers and applications can be
built: Muq systems can and should extend both Muq and
@sc{muf} in a wild variety of ways.  "Let a thousand flowers
bloom."

Amid this sea of chaos, one wishes to preserve a central
isle of stability from which the visitor may survey the
scene: This chapter defines a core layer of functionality
which every Muq @sc{muf} implementation should support,
which I hope is large enough to facilitate the construction
of portable packages, yet small enough that supporting the
full Core is not an undue burden on smaller implementations
(tempting them to implement only a subset).

This chapter documents both muf prims and in-db muf
functions.

"Prim" is short for "primitive".  Prims are so called not
because they are unsophisticated, but because they are the
atomic, irreducible components from which other code in the
system is built up@footnote{"To sophisticate" originally
meant to dilute wine (say) with other fluids, so in the
original sense, "unsophisticated" meant "undiluted".  Muq
primitives are straight C code, undiluted by any hint of
interpretation, and in this sense may be fairly thought of
as unsophisticated.}.

The muf prims are those hardcoded in C in the server itself,
as opposed to library functions coded in muf (or another
in-db language) and compiled into muq bytecodes.

From a system implementation perspective, prims and library
functions are quite different:

Prims may execute up to about one hundred times faster than
library functions, but are trickier to code, require
restarting the server to update, and may crash the entire
server if defective, or failing that may corrupt the db or
punch unintended holes in the security kernel.  Prims also
are locked into the executable image, meaning that they have
to be loaded into ram every time the server starts up, and
tend to stay in ram as long as it is running: a Muq server
could fairly easily support half a gigabyte of library
functions (since they would just sit on disk in the db until
actually needed), but most contemporary workstations would
be overwhelmed by half a gigabyte of primitives.

From the typical Muq programmer's point of view, however,
there is rarely any need to distinguish between prims and
library functions: The syntax is identical in either case.

So much so that we explicitly reserve to the implementor the
decision as to what Core functionality to implement
inserver, and what to implement in-db: We deem unportable
and nonstandard any @sc{muf} code written to depend on the
mode of implementation of any Core function.

This manual does document which functions are prims, and
which in-db @sc{muf}-coded, but such knowledge should be
used only to satisfy curiosity and for performance tuning.

By convention, @sc{muf}-coded Core functionality is kept in
the muq/[0-9][0-9]-C-*.muf files.

@section Function Documentation Conventions
@cindex Function documentation conventions

For purposes of this manual, a @dfn{function} is something
whose semantics are satisfactorily understood in terms of
consuming some (possibly zero) number of input values from
the data stack and returning some (possibly zero) number of
values on the data stack.  Thus, things which are not
mathematical functions, such as @code{frandom}, still
qualify, but things like @code{if} and @code{->} do not, and
are instead termed @dfn{operators}.

A typical function definition looks like

@quotation
@example
join @{ string string -> string @}
File: job.t
Status: alpha
@end example

The @code{join} function concatenates two strings and
returns the resulting string.
@end quotation

The first line gives the name of the function followed by
the the number of values it accepts and returns, separated
by @code{->}.  There may be more than one line like this if
the function does several distinct tasks depending on the
types of its parameters.  Groups of related functions may
also be listed one per line here.  Operators other than
functions (such as function definition, variable assignment,
and control structure operators) give a synoptic usage
example rather than a simple argsIn/argsOut declaration.

Argument abbreviations used include
@table @samp
@item int
An integer.

@item flt
A floating point number.

@item #
An number, integer or floating point.

@item stg
A string.

@item obj
Any variety of object supporting generic keyval operations.

@item []
A stack block
@end table

The second line gives the source file implementing the
function.

The third line will be one of:

@table @samp
@item Status: temporary
This function is needed at the moment but is scheduled to be
replaced by something better.  releases.

@item Status: tentative
The function is offered for discussion and perhaps
experimentation, but is very likely to change in future
releases.

@item Status: alpha
The function is in useful form, but is subject to change if
any possible improvement becomes evident.

@item Status: beta
The function is thought to be final form, but is subject to
change if significant problems are identified in actual use.

@item Status: production
The function is baselined for general use, and incompatible
changes will be made only as a last resort.  (Compatible
extensions, such as allowing additional argument types, may
still be considered.)

Here is a quick table of @sc{muf} to C equivalences:

@example
i j %           Return i % j.  Integer only.
m n *           Return m * n.  Any combination of floats and ints.
m n +           Return m + n.  Any combination of floats and ints.
s t +           Append strings s and t.
m n -           Return m - n.  Any combination of floats and ints.
m n /           Return m / n.  Any combination of floats and ints, n != 0.
n   1+          Return n + 1.  Float or int.
n   1-          Return n - 1.  Float or int.
i j logand      Return i & j.  Int only.
i j logior      Return i | j.  Int only.
i j logxor      Return i ^ j.  Int only.
i j ash         Return i << j. Int only.
i   neg         Return     -i. Float or int.
    frandom     Return a pseudorandom() float:  0.0 <= random < 1.0
    trulyRandomFixnum  Return a truly random nonnegative fixnum. (61 bits.)
i   trulyRandomInteger Return a truly random nonnegative i-bit integer.
i   bits        Return number of bits in integer (offset of first 1 bit).
@end example

Signed integer values of 62 bits or less are handled as immediate
fixnums, and hence are considerably more efficient in space and time.
Other integer values are handled as heap-allocated bignums; Currently
integer precisions of up to a few thousand bits are supported.  Except
for efficiency issues, the distinction between fixnums and bignums
should not normally be user-visible.

The @code{gcd} function returns the Greatest Common
Divisor of two integers, using Euclid's algorithm.

Given @code{X,Y} the @code{egcd} (extended greatest common denominator)
function returns @code{GCD,C,D} where @code{GCD} is the usual greatest
common denominator, and where @code{C} and @code{D} are such that
@code{X*C + Y*D == GCD}.  The extra return values are sometimes useful.
In particular, @code{egcd} may be used to find modular multiplicative
inverses: If @code{X} and @code{Y} are positive and relatively prime
(@code{gcd(X,Y)==1}) with @code{X < Y}, then the multiplicative inverse
of @code{X}, mod @code{Y}, is @code{A}.  Here's a sample routine
returning the multiplicative inverse else @code{nil}:

@example
:  inv @{ $ $ -> $ @}
   -> p  ( The modulus.      )
   -> a  ( Number to invert. )
   a p egcd -> b -> a -> g
   g 1 != if nil return fi ( A and P not relatively prime. )
   a 0 >  if a   return fi
   p a +                   ( Return positive value always. )
;
@end example



The @code{lcm} function returns the Least Common Multiple of
two integers, defined following CommonLisp as @code{abs(a*b)
/ gcd(a,b)}.

The @code{log-*} functions perform bitwise operations on
integers.

The @code{1+} and @code{1-} functions are no faster than
doing @code{1 +} and @code{1 -}, and in fact compile into
the same code: Use or non-use of them is a stylistic choice.

Notes:

@itemize @bullet
@item
I dislike the @code{log*} names (e.g., @code{and-bits} seems
more readable and more consistent with our general verb-noun
naming convention) and particularly dislike @code{ash} for
arithmetic shift, but it seems best to stick with the
CommonLisp standard here.

@item
The current @code{trulyRandomInteger} implementation is a best-effort
approach which operates by maintaining an internal bitbuffer
into which information from asynchronous events is accumulated:
When random bits are requested, a Secure Hash of the bitbuffer
is used as a whitening function and the result returned.  There
is no attempt to guarantee that entropy entered into the bitbuffer
exceeds "truly random" bits extracted from the buffer.  I expect
this implementation to suffice for most intended purposes, in
particular passphrase generation and digital signature applications.
If not, we can improve the algorithm later without changing the
API, and hence without breaking existing dbs in the upgrade.

@item
The @code{generateDiffieHellmanKeyPair} function accepts a generator and prime
@code{g} and @code{p} (typically @code{dh:g} and @code{dh:p}) and
returns a public and private Diffie-Hellman key.  This is equivalent
to doing simply

@example
159 trulyRandomInteger -> privateKey
g privateKey p exptmod -> publicKey
@end example

except that for
security the private key is returned as a special
@code{#<DiffieHellmanPrivateKey>} instead of as an integer.
(@code{#<DiffieHellmanPrivateKey>} values may not be exported,
inspected, or used in ordinary arithmetic operations.)

@item
The @code{generateDiffieHellmanSharedSecret} function is equivalent to

@example
@end example
publicKey privateKey p exptmod
@end itemize

except that (as security precautions) privateKey is required to be a
@code{#<DiffieHellmanPrivateKey>} instead of as an integer, and the
resulting value is a @code{#<DiffieHellmanSharedSecret>} instead of
an integer.

@subsection assembler overview

The Muq assembler uses a procedural rather than text
interface:  To produce a Muq @code{compiledFunction}
you:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Create an Assembler instance using @code{makeAssembler}
(or @code{reset} an existing assembler.

@item
Specify a sequence of instructions using primitive functions
such as @code{assembleBra}, @code{assembleLabel} and @code{assembleCall}.

@item
Call @code{assembleFinishAssembly} to generate and return the
actual compiledFunction.
@end itemize

Here's an example compiling a simple 'hello' function
equivalent to @code{: hello "Hello, world!\n" , ;}

@example
stack:
makeAssembler --> *asm*
stack:
"Hello, world!\n" *asm* assembleConstant
stack:
#', *asm* assembleCall
stack:
nil -1 makeFunction asm finishAssembly
stack: #<c-fn _>
--> #'hello
stack:
hello
Hello, world!
stack:
@end example

Code is deposited monotonically from start to end of
function: there is no way to back up and insert more
instructions between those already laid down.

Jumps are connected to labels by giving them matching ids:
Calling @code{assembleLabel} with an @sc{id} of 13, and
(later or earlier) calling @code{assembleBra} also with an
@sc{id} of 13, results in assembly of an unconditional jump
from the @code{assembleBra} location to the
@code{assembleLabel} location.  It is an error if there is
not exactly one matching label for each branch.  @sc{id}s
should be small integers obtained from
@code{assembleLabelGet}.

Most bytecodes are deposited by doing an
@code{assembleCall} on the appropriate function: The
assembler checks to see if the function is a primitive, and
if so deposits the appropriate bytecodes rather than an
actual call.  This greatly simplifies compiler construction
and maintainance, since the compilers need contain very
little information about the bytecoded instruction set.

The exceptions are the bytecodes which need special
parameters.  These fall into two general classes:

@enumerate
@item
Those which need a label parameter specifying the scope of
some construct (the jumps and error-trapping primitives).

@item
Those which need a parameter specifying an offset into
the constant vector or stackframe (the local-variable
get- and set- primitives, mostly).
@end enumerate

Note that there are special assembler functions to push
@sc{catchframes} and @sc{unwindframes,} but no special
functions to pop them.  This is because they can be popped
merely by invoking @code{assembleCall} on
@code{popCatchframe} and @code{popUnwindframe}. The
corresponding pushes cannot be handled this way because they
need to reference a code label.

Note that @sc{lockframes} (implementing
@code{withLockDo@{@dots{}@}}) are both pushed and popped in
this fashion, using @code{pushLockframe} and
@code{popLockframe}.

@subsection assembler after

@defun assembleAfter @{ label asm -> @}
@display
@exdent file: job.t
@exdent package: muf
@exdent status: alpha
@end display

The @code{assembleAfter} prim is a specialized hack
supporting the @sc{muf} @code{after@{ @dots{} @}alwaysDo@{ @dots{} @}}
construct -- and matching constructs in other languages.

We implement @code{after@{ @dots{} @}alwaysDo@{ @dots{} @} }
as follows:
@example
assembleLabelGet  -> label1
assembleLabelGet  -> label2
label1 asm assembleAfter                    ( Push a @sc{protectframe} )
@dots{}                                      ( Protected code clause )
label2 asm assembleAlwaysDo                ( Convert frame to @sc{vanilla} )
label1 asm assembleLabel                    ( Label matching @sc{after} )
@dots{}                                      ( Mandatory code clause )
label2 a assembleLabel                      ( Label end of clause )
.lib.muf.popUnwindframe a assembleCall     ( Pop @sc{vanilla} frame. )
@end example

This is internally the most complex of the control
structures to implement, and what can actually happen gets
somewhat involved.

For example, if a @code{throw} is executed in the
protected first clause, it must be interrupted
long enough for the second clause to be executed,
and then resumed at the end of the second clause.

This is implemented by pushing an appropriate
frame on the loop stack as a flag before beginning
execution of the second clause; popUnwindframe
then checks the frame on top of the loopstack when
it executes: if it finds a VANILLA frame, it
merely pops it and lets execution continue; if it
finds a special flag frame, it pops it and
continues the interrupted operation, whatever it
was.

Additional complexities arise if the protected
clause contains fork operations, since the second
clause must still be executed exactly once
(@emph{not} exactly once per job).

However, the above boilerplate sequence is all one needs
to know as an in-db compiler writer in order to implement
the construct.

The @code{assembleBeq} prim is one of four
functions provided in support of basic
control structures such as @code{if-then-else}
and @code{loop@{@dots{}@}}.

The @code{assembleBeq} deposits a conditional
branch to the given @code{label}.

At runtime, the deposited branch will pop one
value from the data stack:  If that value is
@code{nil}, the next instruction executed with
be that located at @code{label}, otherwise
execution continues normally with the next
instruction.

For example, @code{: ab if "a" else "b" fi ;} can be
compiled so:

@example

@end display

The @code{assembleTag} prim supports
implementation of non-local @code{goto} operations
-- those which jump from one function to an
enclosing function, much like the C
@code{longjmp()} library function.

The @code{assembleTag} prim deposits an
instruction which at runtime will pop a tag from
the job's data stack and push a
@sc{job_stackframe_tag} stackframe onto the job's
loop stack, containing the popped tag together
with the given @code{label}: As long as that
stackframe exists, any @code{goto} of that tag
will result in a transfer of control to the given
@code{label}.

You may mark the end of the tag's scope by
popping the @sc{job_stackframe_tag} stackframe
using the @code{popTagframe} primitive.

For technical reasons relating to support for
the CommonLisp standard, any sequence of one
or more @sc{job_stackframe_tag} stackframes
pushed on the loopstack should be topped off
with a @sc{job_stackframe_tagtop} frame: These
can be pushed and popped using
@code{pushTagtopframe}
and @code{popTagtopframe}.

Here is an example which hand-compiles

@example
:   xx 
    withTag qqq do@{  ( Establish nonlocal goto target  )

The @code{assembleCall} prim is the workhorse
assembler call used to assemble all vanilla instructions
-- those which don't have an associated label or
other similar peculiarity.

Note in particular that the @code{assembleCall}
prim is used to deposit calls to both functions
coded in-db, and also primitive functions coded
in-server in C: The Muq compiler writer has in
general no need to distinguish between these two
cases, and Muq compilers have in general no need
to contain a list of all primitives supported by
the Muq virtual machine.  (This both simplifies
the Muq compilers, and means that they do not need
to be recoded if a given function changes from
being a C-coded prim to being coded in-db.)

The @code{function} argument may be either a
compiledFunction, or else a symbol containing
a compiledFunction in its @code{symbolFunction}
slot (@code{symbol$s.function}).

For example, here's a hand-assembly of the
function @code{: x * ;}

@example
makeAssembler --> *asm*
stack:
*asm* reset
stack:
#'* *asm* assembleCall
stack:
nil -1 makeFunction *asm* finishAssembly --> #'x ( Compile fn 'x' )

The @code{finishAssembly} prim complete assembly
of a function and returns the resulting

If the @code{force} argument is non-@code{nil}, the
compiledFunction is assigned the specified
@code{arity} without attempting to verify that
it is correct.

If the @code{force} argument is @code{nil}, the
assembler does a simple symbolic execution of
the function to deduce its arity (number of
blocks and scalars accepted and returned).
The simple symbolic execution algorithm is
sufficient to automatically deduce the arity
of many functions, but will currently fail
on recursive functions.

The @code{arity} value may be constructed
using @code{implodeArity}, or may be set
to @code{-1} meaning "dunno".

The @code{function} argument is a Class Function
instance in which to store info about the
generated @code{compiledFunction}, including
for example the arity and the source code.

Muq @sc{muf} uses a different and variable reference syntax
from traditional muf or forth, one which I believe to be
more readable.

One important difference between Muq @sc{muf} and
traditional @sc{muf} or Forth is that Muq @sc{muf} has true
local variables with scope limited to the function within
which they are declared -- what C calls "automatic"
variables.

I believe lack of true local variables and consequent abuse
of the data stack via obscure sequences of operators like
@code{rot, swap, dup, over} contributed mightily to making
traditional @sc{muf} and Forth code less readable than it
should be.  I have worked hard to make Muq @sc{muf} local
variables efficient enough that programmers will not
hesitate to use them, and to give them a syntax that
promotes readability of the resulting code.

Local variables within a function are referenced simply by
mentioning their name, and are assigned values by using a
short right-arrow followed by their name:

@example
salary savings + -> new-salary
@end example

@noindent
I believe this exhibits better visual flow and less noise
than the traditional

@example
salary @@ savings @@ + new-salary !
@end example

@noindent
quite aside from the complete lack of local variables in
traditional @sc{muf} and Forth.

The Muq @sc{muf} @code{->} operator will automatically
create a local variable of the given name if none currently
exists within the function.  This again reduces the amount
of syntactic noise and busywork involved in using local
variables.  Such automatic declaration of variables at need
is accepted practice in value-typed application languages,
where no type need be specified for a variable, and where
the emphasis is on convenience of interactive hacking rather
than strong type-checking of large programs.



In Muq @sc{muf,} global variables (that is, symbols in the
currently open package) and properties on objects are set
using a similar syntax:

@example
value --> global            ( Store into a symbol. )
value --> .u["cynbe"].tmp.x ( Store into a property. )
value --> me.tmp.x           ( Same as above when done by cynbe. )
@end example

@noindent
Note that this arrow is longer than that used for local
variables.  This is a reflection of the fact that access to
symbols and properties is a slower and more dangerous
operation: Programmers, like most people, tend to follow the
path of least resistance, and we wish to encourage them to
use local variables in preference to symbols or object
properties, when given a choice.

@example
Stack:
makeIndex --> o
Stack:
1 --> o.a   2 --> o.b   3 --> o.c
Stack: 
o.a o.b o.c
Stack: 1 2 3
@end example

A convenient syntax for deleting properties is

@example
delete: .u["cynbe"].tmp.x
@end example

@noindent
which removes property @code{x} from object @code{.u["cynbe"].tmp}.

The @code{--} and @code{++} are short notations for
incrementing or decrementing a symbol or local variable.

@example
-- my-local-var      ( Subtract one from given local variable. )
++ *my-symbol*       ( Add one to value of given symbol. )
@end example

@noindent
These produce exactly the same code as

@example
my-local-var 1 -  -> my-local-var
*my-symbol*  1 + --> *my-symbol*
@end example

@noindent
The point is only to improve readability by providing a more
concise notation for a common operation.

The @code{-->constant} operator works exactly like the
@code{-->} except that it should only be applied to symbols,
and it marks the symbol as being a constant.  Declaring a
symbol to be a constant is a promise to the compiler that
you will never change its value.  More specifically:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The compiler will freely substitute the value of the
symbol for references to it.  This makes for faster
code.

@item
Any subsequent attempt to set any slot on the symbol will be
an error, and usually signaled as such.
@end itemize

As a deliberate exception, you may change a constant's value
using @code{-->constant}, but in such a case it is strictly
up to you to ensure that all affected code gets recompiled.
(This exception is motivated primarily by a wish to let
files be reloaded without producing error messages.)

The @code{=>} operator is a borrowing from Lisp: It binds a
value to the given symbol.  In CommonLisp nomenclature, this
binding has @emph{indefinite scope} and @emph{dynamic
extent}: This means roughly that the binding is visible in
all other functions, not just the current one, but ends when
the current function exits.  (More precisely, when the
current function, @code{@{@}}-scope or @code{if/else/fi}
clause is exited.)  Binding is handy when you want to change
a global value temporarily, but want it automatically
restored to the previous value when you are done.

Binding has some special quirks in the Muq context:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Bindings are visible only within the current job.
This can be an advantage or a disadvantage, depending on
the situation.
@item
You may bind a Muq symbol even if you don't
own it, and hence cannot set it.
@item
The Muq binding mechanism is not terribly efficient:
All existing bindings are searched in sequence each
time a symbol value is retrieved.  You should avoid
binding large numbers of symbols if efficiency is at
all an issue.
@end itemize

The @code{]->} operator is simply a shorthand for
@code{]shift ->}.  @xref{]shift}.

The @code{]-->} operator is simply a shorthand for
@code{]shift -->}.

A major syntactic difference between Lisp and Forth is that
Lisp explicitly indicates the lexical scope of every
operator via a pair of parentheses.  This results in a lot
of syntactic noise, but does make it easy to cope with
operators which take a variable number of arguments.

Forth, by contrast, almost never explicitly indicates the
lexical scope of an operator, and in consequence almost all
operators are forced to take a fixed number of arguments.
This reduces syntactic clutter enormously, but the inability
to deal with variable numbers of arguments can be almost
crippling at times.

The tinymuck @sc{muf} coding community has evolved a
workaround for this problem, which consists of passing a
block of values on the stack, with a count of the number of
values in the block sitting atop it.

Muq @sc{muf} systematizes this ad hoc practice by providing
a consistent syntax for such operators, and by providing a
general set of tools for manipulating such stack blocks.
The result is that the @sc{muf} programmer can frequently
operate very concisely on complete blocks of data without
writing explicit loops, with a gain in notational
conciseness vaguely similar to that achieved by APL, and
much more closely related to that achieved by unix shell
commands using pipes.  In honor of the latter, the Muq
@sc{muf} syntax is chosen to be somewhat suggestive of that
used by unix shells for constructing pipes, although the
underlying implementation mechanisms are very different.

The general syntactic @sc{muf} conventions for dealing with
stack blocks are:

@example
Names of functions depositing a block on the stack end with '['.
Names of functions which transform a block on the stack start with '|'.
Names of functions which pop a block off the stack start with ']'.
@end example

These conventions provide immediate, obvious warning to
anyone reading the @sc{muf} code that block operations are
taking place.  In addition, given these conventions, a few
simple syntactic code-writing rules make it easy to write
reasonable block code, and to spot questionable block code
at a glance:

@display
@cartouche
Every '[' should be folloed  by a matching ']'.
Every ']' should be preceded by a matching '['.
Every '|' should be between a '[' @dots{} ']' pair.
@end cartouche
@end display

Given appropriate functions, a variety of useful computations
become quite simple to do interactively in a coding style
reminiscient of unix filters.  For example

@example
.who vals[ "z*" |grep |length -> i ]pop i
@end example

@noindent
is a plausible command to count the number of people
currently logged in whose name starts with 'z'.  We
assume here that:

@display
@code{vals[} pushes all keys on a given object on the stack in a block.
@code{|grep} removes all keys not matching a regular expression from block.
@code{|length} counts the number of items in a block.
@code{]pop} removes a block from the stack.
@end display

(At present, all the above operators are implemented exept
@code{|grep}; implementation of regular expressions is still
at an early stage.)

@noindent
@sc{warning:} Stack blocks are currently implemented as
simply N args on the stack with an integer count atop, but
code should not be written to depend on this.  A future
version of Muq is likely to use a special top-of-block
indicator rather than just an integer.  Use the provided
functions to construct and manipulate blocks.

Stack:

@end example

This operator pair is particularly handy in constructing a stack block
to pass to a function.  For example, "]print" is muf's equivalent to C
sprintf, and takes as arguments a block containing a format string
followed by any arguments to be formatted:

@example
Stack:

Converts a string into a block of one int per char,
according to their @sc{ascii} encodings:

@example

Pushes a block containing the alphanumeric words in a given string:

@example
Stack:
"The goddess is alive, and magic is afoot" stringWords[
Stack: [ "The" "goddess" "is" "alive" "and" "magic" "is" "afoot" |
@end example
@xref{chopString[}.
@end defun

For conciseness, this operator is also available as @code{words[}.
@xref{chopString[}. @xref{substring}.

@c

@subsection chopString[
@defun chopString[ @{ stg delim -> [stgs] @}
@display
@exdent file: job.t
@exdent package: muf
@exdent status: alpha
@end display

Both arguments are usually strings (although the
@code{delim} argument may instead be a character): All
instances of @code{delim} are removed from @code{stg},
and the resulting fragments returned in a block:

@example
Stack:
"ag::995:30:Alexander the Geek:/q/ag:msh" ":" chopString[
Stack: [ "ag" "" "995" "30" "Alexander the Geek" "/q/ag" "msh" |
"" |delete
Stack: [ "ag" "995" "30" "Alexander the Geek" "/q/ag" "msh" |
@end example
@end defun

A more frequent case is splitting on blanks:

@example
Stack:
"now is the time " " " chopString[ "" |delete
Stack: [ "now" "is" "the" "time" |
@end example

As a special case, a null delimiter string breaks the string
into one-character substrings:

@example
Stack:
"Alexandria" "" chopString[
Stack: [ "A" "l" "e" "x" "a" "n" "d" "r" "i" "a" |
|unsort
Stack: [ "a" "n" "x" "r" "i" "d" "e" "a" "A" "l" |

A quick way of comparing a block of chars vs a
string for textual equality.

The block should contain chars or ints.  The
@code{|=} prim returns @code{nil} unless the
block is the same length as @code{string}, and
unless the low 8 bits of each char or int match the value
of the corresponding byte in the @code{string}.

@example
Stack:
[ 'a' 'b' 'c' 'd' 'e' | "abcde" |=
Stack: [ 'a' 'b' 'c' 'd' 'e' | t
@end example

@end defun

@subsection |charInt
@defun |charInt @{ [] -> [] @}
@display
@exdent file: job.t
@exdent package: muf

@end display

All characters in the given block are converted to
integers.  Other values are left unchanged.

@example
Stack:
[ 'a' 'b' 'c' "d" :e |
Stack: [ 'a' 'b' 'c' "d" :e |
|charInt
Stack: [ 97 98 99 "d" :e |

Given @code{arg} and a block, @code{|delete} removes all
instances of @code{arg} from the block:

@example
Stack:
"ag::995:30:Alexander the Geek:/q/ag:msh" ":" chopString[
Stack: [ "ag" "" "995" "30" "Alexander the Geek" "/q/ag" "msh" |

@exdent package: muf
@exdent status: alpha
@end display

The @code{|deleteNonchars} removes all
non-character values (those for which
@code{char?} is not true) from the
given block.

This is useful for stripping address information from
datagrams, and similar cases where a keyval header
is present in a block of characters.

@example
Stack:
[ :ip0 127 :ip1 0 :ip2 0 :ip3 1 'a' 'b' 'c' |S
Stack: [ :ip0 127 :ip1 0 :ip2 0 :ip3 1 'a' 'b' 'c' |

@display
@exdent file: job.t
@exdent package: muf
@exdent status: alpha
@end display

The @code{|doCBackslashes} function is a simple
compiler convenience function which
implements the C backslash convention on a block
of characters -- sequences consisting of a backslash
character followed by another character are contracted
to the single corresponding character.

The current list of escapes recognized:

@example
'\0'
'\a'
'\b'
'\f'
'\n'
'\r'
'\t'
'\v'
@end example

(Other characters preceded by backslash simply
reduce to themselves.)

While this function is intended to be used on blocks of
characters, it is not an error to have non-character
values in the block.

@display
@exdent file: job.t
@exdent package: muf
@exdent status: alpha
@end display

The @code{|backslashesToHighbit}
function is a simple
compiler convenience function which converts
a block of chars to a block of ints with the
corresponding @sc{ascii} values, except that
(non-backslashed) backslashes have been
dropped, and a high (0x1000) bit set on the following
characters.

The result is a convenient representation
used by the Muq compilers to represent a
token while remembering which characters
were quoted.

If unwanted, the quote bits may be stripped out using
the @code{|intChar} function.

@subsection |downcase
@defun |downcase do@{ [] -> [] @}

The @code{|downcase} prim converts to lowercase any
character or integer values in the block.  (Integer

The @code{|dup} prim pushes on the
stack a copy of the top (last) element of the block,
which is left unchanged.

Given @code{n} and a block, @code{|dupNth} pushes on the
stack a copy of the nth element in the block, which is left
unchanged.  The bottom (leftmost) element in the block is
element zero:

@example
Stack:

Given a block of @sc{n} items, loops @sc{n} times,
with the designated variable set successively to
each item in the block.  Changing the variable will
change the corresponding element of the block:

@example
Stack:
5 seq[
Stack: [ 0 1 2 3 4 |
|for v do@{ v 2 * -> v @}
Stack: [ 0 2 4 6 8 |
@end example

The optional second argument will iterate through the block indices:

@example
Stack: [ 0 2 4 6 8 |
|for v i do@{ [ "blk[%d] is %d\n" i v | ]print , @}
blk[0] is 0
blk[1] is 2
blk[2] is 4
blk[3] is 6
blk[4] is 8
Stack: [ 0 2 4 6 8 |
@end example
@end defun

Note: The body of a @code{|for} should not change the size
of the block.

Note: The body of a @code{|for} may accumulate results on
top of the iterated block.  This is not generally
recommended, but occasionally very useful.  See the
implementations of @code{map*} in @file{10-C-lists.muf}.
Such accumulation is liable to confuse the arity-deduction
code: You will likely need to include a '!' in your arity
declaration for the function.

Given a block of @sc{2n} items, loops @sc{n} times,
with the designated variables @code{k} and @code{v}
set successively to
each sequential pair of values in the block.  Changing the

Stack: [ 0 1 2 3 4 |
|forPairs k v do@{ v 2 * -> v @}
Stack: [ 0 2 2 6 4 10 |

The optional third argument will iterate through the block indices
used:

|forPairs k v i do@{ [ "blk[%d] is %d\n" i k | ]print , @}
blk[0] is 0

Given @code{key} default value @code{deflt}, and a block
interpreted as keyval pairs, @code{|ged} (GEt with Default)
returns the value corresponding to @code{key} in the block,

@example

pop :d 13 |ged

This function is intended for functions which take a block
of keyword-labelled arguments, some of which may be optionally
omitted and which default to non-@code{nil} values:

@example
: fn @{ [] -> @}
   :key0 deflt0 |ged -> val0
   :key1 deflt1 |ged -> val1
   :key2 deflt2 |ged -> val2
   ...
   :keyN defltN |ged -> valN
   ]pop
   ( Stuff depending on val0..valN. )
;
@end example

Keywords are the recommended type of key, but any datatype
may be used.

This type of parameter passing is not suitable for simple,
efficiency-critical, commonly used functions, but is very
suitable for obscure functions which take many parameters,
some of little interest to many users, and especially if
you'd like to maintain the option to add more parameters in
future without breaking existing code.

@code{|gep} is exactly the same as @code{|ged} except that
the key/val pair matched, if any, is also popped from the

The @code{left} and @code{right} values must be
characters;  They are interpreted as a matching
pair of brackets, just as () [] or @{@}.

Search the contents of the block for an integer
value corresponding to the first @code{right}
bracket not matched by a @code{left} bracket.  If
such a value is found, return the integer offset
of the block location in which it is found;
Otherwise, return @code{nil}.

Integer values in the block above 255 are ignored.

This function is based on the Secure Hash Function (@sc{sha}-1),
as specified by international standard @sc{fips pub 180-1}:  It
mixes the information in the given block together to produce a
twenty-byte signature, which is then appended to the block:

@end example

One use is to append the signature to the block before
transmitting it over an unreliable medium, and then to
verify it at the other end:  If any bytes have become
accidentally garbled, it is extremely unlikely the
signature will still match.

Another use is in authentication:  If Alice and Bob share
a secret string, and Alice sends Bob @code{ message +
secureHash( message + secret )}, Bob can verify (with
very high probability) that whoever sent the message
must have known the secret, hence is probably Alice.

Topological sort:  Resolve a partial ordering
into a total ordering.

The input is a block of pairs @code{s t} interpreted
as meaning that @code{s} must
precede @code{t} in the result.

The result block contains a total ordering of the
given value, consistent with the given partial
ordering constraints, if possible, below
a @code{t} result flag.

If the input block contains a constraint cycle,
then a consistent total ordering is not possible,
and a @code{nil} result flag is returned;  The
contents of the block are undefined.

The following example specifies that 'i' must
precede 'x', 'n' must precede 'i', and 'u' must
precede 'n'.  The computed solution is unique:

@example
Stack: [ 'i' 'x'   'n' 'i'   'u' 'n' |

The @code{]makeNumber} prim is a hardcoded
speed hack intended to be used by the Muq
compilers (for example, the Lisp
@code{read} function) to translate a number
token (see @code{|potentialNumber?})
into the corresponding number.  The @code{typ}
return value indicates the type of number,
being one of the integer constants
@example
lisp:lispBadnum

The @code{|findSymbol?} prim is a
compiler-support function which accepts a block
of integer-coded characters
such as returned by @code{lisp:|classifyLispToken} or
@code{|backslashesToHighbit} and returns the
corresponding symbol as @code{sym} if found, else
@code{nil}.  The @code{found} return value will be
@code{nil} unless the symbol was found.

The @code{|findSymbol?} prim distinguishes four
token types:

@table @code
@item :sss
A keyword symbol.  Looked up in the keyword
package, created if not found.

@item sss
A vanilla symbol.  Looked up first as a private
symbol in the current
package (@code{@@$s.package}), then as a public
(exported) symbol in all packages used by the
current package, finally in the default compiler
package @code{default-pkg} if it is a package.

@item ppp:sss
Looked up as a public symbol in package
@code{ppp}.

@item ppp::sss
Looked up as a private symbol in package
@code{ppp}, then as a public symbol in any
package used by @code{ppp}.

The @code{|positionInStack?} prim is a
compiler-support function which accepts a block of
integer-coded characters such as returned by
@code{lisp:|classifyLispToken} or
@code{|backslashesToHighbit} and searches the
given @code{stack} for a matching string.

The usual use is to maintain a block-structured
local symbol table in the @code{stack}, with
alternating string keys and function/integer
values.

As usual, one motivation for expressing the
@code{[token]} argument as a block of ints
instead of as a string, is to minimize
generation of garbage strings by the Muq
compilers:  It is usually possible to
tokenize the compiler input and look up
the results in the symbol tables entirely
without garbage generation.

The @code{]makeVector} function stores the contents of the

@end display

The @code{]makeEphemeralVector} function is much like
the @code{]makeVector} function, except that it returns
an ephemeral (stack-allocated) vector instead of a
vanilla (heap-allocated) vector.

The only advantage of using an ephemeral vector is that
stack allocation is generally more efficient than
heap allocation, since the storage is automatically
released upon return from the function creating the
vector, without need to run the garbage collector.
This can be a significant advantage if you are
creating lots of vectors with very short lifetimes.

In all other cases, you should avoid using
ephemeral vectors, due to the potential problems
they introduce:

Ephemeral vectors are only useful within the job
that created them (that is, the job on whose
loop stack they reside).  Thus, storing an
ephemeral vector in the db, or passing it to
another job via a message stream, is almost
always a bad idea.  The other job will wind up
looking in its own loop stack for the ephemeral
vector, and either not find it or (worse) find
the wrong one.

Ephemeral vectors should normally be created at
the start of a function.  If you must create
one within a "with@dots{}do@{" type nested scope,
you should pop the vector off the stack at the
end of the construct using @code{popEphemeralVector}:
Otherwise, you'll get an error when the function
attempts to exit the scope and finds an unexpected
vector pushed on the loop stack.

For those of us addicted to conciseness, this function
is also available under the synonym @code{]evec}.

The @code{]keysvalsMake} operator consumes a block of keyVal pairs,

Stack: "Testing: 18 13 123.4559 5.42999e+22"

The @code{]rootLogPrint} operator is just like @code{]print} except that

There is also a @code{muf:]logPrint} function intended to be called by

The @code{|debyte} function is a rough inverse to the @code{|enbyte}
function, converting a portable pure-bytes block produced by

If @code{failed} is a fixnum (@code{fixnum?}, the conversion failed and
@code{failed} is a hashName not listed in @code{.usersBy.hashName}:
Caller should discard the stackblock and request full information
corresponding to that hashName from the source of the stackblock,
probably via @code{muq/pkg/190-C-muqnet:sendGetUserInfo}.

If @code{failed} is a string (@code{string?}, the conversion failed for

The @code{eq} operator is a weird speed hack which
is best avoided unless you are very sure you know
what you are doing.  It simply compares the two
given arguments as machine words, and hence its
results depend on implementation details of the
various datatypes.  In the current (-1.5.0) Muq
implemention, @code{eq} will distinguish floats,
ints and characters correctly, and strings of
three characters or less, and beyond this will
distinguish objects which have different

This operator pops a @sc{catch} frame off the loop stack;
It is used to mark the end of a @code{catch@{ @dots{} @} }

In a strict sense, the return value is always @code{nil}
atop an empty block.  But if an error is encountered,
it will push a block of diagnostic information and then
a @code{t} value and then resume execution after the
@code{popCatchframe} instruction, so as a practical
matter the instruction may be thought of as returning
either @code{nil} or @sc{t} depending whether an error
was detected, atop a block which contains diagnostic
information if one was.

This function returns the contents of the nth restart
from the @emph{top} of the loop stack, along with a
value which may be used to refer to it in future (the
integer offset of the restart within the stack, as it
happens -- but code should not be written to depend on
this).  The top restart is number zero.

The return values are:

@table @strong
@item name
@code{:name} symbol specified when creating restart.
@item fn
@code{:function} function specified when creating restart.
@item tFn
@code{:testFunction} function specified when creating restart.
@item iFn
@code{:interactiveFunction} function specified when creating restart.
@item rFn
@code{:reportFunction} function specified when creating restart.
@item data
@code{:data} value specified when creating restart, else @code{nil}.
@item id
@code{nil} if no nth restart was found, else a
restart label usable with @code{getRestart}.
@item ok

This function is used internally by @code{]signal}
and kin to find handlers.  @emph{It is not
normally called directly by the application
programmer, and may well change in future
releases.}  It is a specialCase hack tuned
specifically for the convenience of @code{]signal}
and kin.

The @code{[args]} block is presumably the argument
block to be given to the selected handler(s).  The
@code{|getAllActiveHandlers[} does not modify
or inspect this block in any way, merely copies it
to be above the constructed @code{[handlers]} block.

The @code{[handlers]} block returned contains
@code{k} Events followed by @code{k} handlers,
pairs given originally to
@code{]withHandlersDo@{}.  Busy handler sets are
ignored: All handlers in the returned
@code{[handlers]} block are eligible to handle a
signal.

The @code{lo} and @code{hi} return values are
indices into the data stack delimiting the
Events portion of the
@code{[handlers]} block, such that

@example
for i from lo below hi do@{
    i     dupBth -> event
    i k + dupBth -> handler
    ...
@}
@end example

@noindent
will correctly iterate over all event handler
pairs, most recent bindings first.

Example:

@example
Stack:
[ .err.warning :: ; | ]withHandlerDo@{ [ | |getAllActiveHandlers[ @}
Stack: [ #<event warning> #<c-fn _> | [ | 2 3 1
@end example

(Note: This example assumes an unrealistically
simple runtime environment. Most actual Muq
runtime environments will produce additional
handlers if the example is run.)

Rationale: We fetch all active handlers in a
block, rather than looping with a get-nth type
function, because this reduces the work done from
O(N^2) in the stack size to O(N) in the stack
size.  Probably not a major issue most of the
time, but it is little if any extra work to avoid
the possible O(N^2) blowup, and making the
event system as efficient as practical may
encourage its use.

This function is used internally by @code{]signal}
and kin to invoke a handler.  @emph{It is not
normally called directly by the application
programmer.}  The @code{handler} argument
specifies the handler to invoke.  This argument is
@emph{not} a pointer to the handler proper, but
rather a handler @sc{id} as returned by
@code{|getAllActiveHandlers[}.

The reason we use @code{]invokeHandler} to invoke
a handler function, rather than just calling it
directly, is that @code{]invokeHandler} pushes a
@sc{handling} stackframe and then calls the
handler, all in one atomic operation, guaranteeing
that the handler set cannot possibly be handling
more than one signal at a time.  This guarantee is
required by the CommonLisp standard because it
prevents nasty bugs and coding headaches which
could otherwise occur.

Before calling the indicated handler, @code{]invokeHandler}
switches to the @code{actingUser} which was in effect at
the time the handler binding was established.  (This is
intended to avoid odd and difficult-to-trace problems due to
a signal arriving when some unexpected @code{actingUser} is
in effect.)  A @sc{job_stackframe_tmp_user} stackframe is
pushed before making the call, which will result in the
pre-@code{]invokeHandler} @code{actingUser} being restored
upon (any kind of) exit from the handler.

The @code{]invokeDebugger} function is a standard
way for a Muq program to enter the debugger.

If @code{@@$s.debuggerHook} is a compiled function,
it will be called with the event block and the
value of @code{@@$s.debuggerHook} itself.  We pass
the latter because @code{@@$s.debuggerHook} is set to
@code{nil} while the hook function is executing.

If @code{@@$s.debuggerHook} returns, then if
@code{@@$s.debugger} is a compiled function, it is
invoked with the event as argument.  (The event
is first converted from a stackblock to a vector
via @code{]makeVector}.) This function
should never return.  (If it does,
@code{]invokeDebugger} will in desperation kill the
job.)

Note that @code{@@$s.debugger} is set at login to the
value of @code{me$s.debugger}: thus the way to
``permanently'' change to another debugger is to set
@code{me$s.debugger} to the desired function.

By default, the standard Muq db binds @code{me$s.debugger}
to @code{mufDebugger}.  @xref{mufDebugger}.

For a very simple example, try:

@example
withTag my-tag do@{
    [   :function :: @{ -> ! @} 'my-tag goto ;
        :name     'my-restart
        :reportFunction "Continue from 'my-tag"
    | ]withRestartDo@{
        [ | ]invokeDebugger

restart which lets you continue from where you left

This function is the most vanilla way to invoke the
event system.

The argument block to this function consists of
keyVal pairs, and will be handed unchanged to
the signal handlers.  (The block may currently
not contain more than 64 keyval pairs:  See
the rationale at end of this subsection.)

One keyval pair must always be present:

@example
:event C
@end example

@noindent
where @code{C} is a Event object.  This
specifies the particular type of event
being signaled.

An important optional keyval pair is

@example
:job J
@end example

where @code{J} is a Job object.  If this keyval is
provided, the signal is sent to the specified job,
and is handled (or not) by whatever handlers that
job has established.  If no @code{:job J} keyval
is provided, the signal is sent to the currently
executing job.

In order to send a signal to another job, the
actingUser must be the same as the actualUser of
the other job, or else must be root running with
the @sc{omnipotent} bit set: Otherwise the signal
will be silently ignored.

Any other keyval pairs present will be ignored by
@code{]signal} but may be meaningful to any signal
handlers invoked.

Signals sent to other jobs via @code{]signal}
always return.

Signals sent to the currently running job
return if and only if all ``relevant'' handlers
return.

A handler is ``relevant'' if the event
associated with the handler is the same as the
event @code{C} being signaled (or is a parent
of @code{C}), and if that handler is not part of a
handler set already handling a signal.

Note that these signals are @emph{unreliable}:
There is no guarantee that any handler will be
invoked, even if present, since it might be busy
handling another signal.

@strong{Rationale:} The definition of this
function was selected with the intention that it
be a primary means of communication between Muq
jobs, yet anticipating that in general these jobs
may not be on the same Muq server.  It is intended
that one reasonable implementation of signals in
such a case be via @sc{udp} packet.

Unreliable signals are appropriate for a variety
of state-update tasks in multi-user interactive
settings, such as tracking cursor position: If a
particular update gets lost, the next update will
rectify matters anyhow, so there is no need for
expensive reliable-delivery mechanisms, and in
particular no need to block the sender for a full
roundTrip time over the network.

It is anticipated that when reliable delivery of
information is needed, that streams rather than
signals will be used, and that the underlying
implementation will in this case use a reliable
stream protocol such as @code{tcp}.

When appropriate, you may of course implement your
own acknowledgement protocol on top of the basic
Muq signal facility: Waiting for a return signal
after each signal, or checking for a heartbeat
every N milliseconds or whatever.

Signal blocks are limited to 128 entries (configurable
by changing @sc{job_signal_block_max} and recompiling)
partly because signals are intended for brief notifications,
not (say) file transfer, and need to fit in a datagram
without excessive fragmentation or spamming the net
interface.

@strong{Future directions:} Due to limitations such as
UDP packet size, it is likely that future Muq releases
will place a limit on the total size in bytes of the
keyword names.  It is reasonably safe to assume that
such limit will support an aggregate half a K or so of
keyval names.  (The default Maximum Transmission Unit
size on the Internet is 576 bytes; Ideally
@code{]signal} blocks should be about this size, or
smaller.)

This function is invoked by the @code{]signal}
primitive to do the work of actually generating a list
of all active handlers, then sequentially invokes each
handler appropriate to the given event, most recent
binding first, until one doesn't return.  If all
return, @code{]doSignal} returns nothing.

The in-server @code{signal[} operator itself
merely handles the necessary magic to pass the
event block between jobs, if needed, then
invokes the in-db @code{]doSignal} function to do
the rest of the work.

Customization of @code{]doSignal} is possible:
@code{]signal} actually runs whatever function it
finds in the @@$s.doSignal property of the
recipient job.  You may set this property to
anything you like.  If it is not set to a valid
@code{compiledFunction} object, @code{]signal}
will silently ignore all events raised.

The @code{continue} function invokes the most recent

@node  why unreliable signals?, control structure syntax, ]warn, event system functions
@subsection why unreliable signals?

Why should the basic Muq signal system be unreliable?
Shouldn't it promise reliable signal delivery at least
within a given server, when no network packet loss problems
are involved?  Shouldn't the server at the very least
guarantee that a division-by-zero signal within a job always
gets reliably delivered?

Perhaps it should!  But there are reasonable arguments
against this:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Our principal standard, CommonLisp, specifies unreliable signals.
Having reliable signals too would mean more or less two
separate signal systems within the same server, which
is clearly to be avoided if possible.

@item
Having more than one copy of the same signal handler
running at the same time in the same task presents
problems which the server can't hide from the app
programmer:  It means any datastructures manipulated
by the handler can easily get munged due to interleaved
execution.  The normal solution would be to use a lock,
but this doesn't work here because it would be the same
job already holding the lock, so you'd get either no
change or deadlock, depending on whether your lock
allowed the same job in again or not.  Some more
ingenious solution would be required in such handlers,
and most application programmers would just ignore the
problem, leading to obscure and unrepeatable timing-
dependent errors.  All in all, re-invoking a handler
which is already running sounds like a mess to be
avoided if at all possible.

@item
If handlers which are already running are not to be
interrupted, the only remaining strategy for implementing
reliable signals is to queue up signals as they are sent.
But now we have the problem that the signal producer can
easily outrun the signal consumer:  Our queue may get
arbitrarily large, perhaps limited only by available
disk space.  Now either we have to depend on the signal
producer to check the queue size (which again most app
programmers probably won't bother to do) or we need to
block the signal producer when the queue reaches some
limit.  But now we've basically re-implemented message
streams, which we already have, at the cost of sacrificing
nice properties of signals that some people might want,
such as being able to count on them always returning
"immediately":  We seem to me to have made the signal
implementation more expensive while reducing its utility.
@end itemize

It may be worth clarifying what we mean by signals being
"unreliable" within a given server: We mean that there is no
guarantee that a given signal sent to a given job will have
any effect on that job, @emph{because} if the only appropriate
signal handler is already running, the new signal will
simply be silently discarded.

To take the division-by-zero example, this means that a
division-by-zero notification will be lost only if the
division-by-zero happens in the division-by-zero handler.
But isn't this what one wants, really?  If the
division-by-zero handler is generating division-by-zero
events, re-invoking it will probably simply lead to an
infinite recursion followed by a stack overflow, which
doesn't seem an improvement.  Under the Muq unreliable
signal system, any division-by-zero exceptions raised within
the division-by-zero handler will be handled by any prior
division-by-handler if present, else by any more general
error handler if present, else simply ignored.  I think this
is just about right.

For special cases where the signal absolutely -must- go
through, but regular message streams are for some reason
insufficient, one can build a more sophisticated mechanism
on top of the basic Muq server facility, perhaps using some
combination of both message streams and signals, or perhaps
waiting for an acknowledging signal and resending after some
timeout, or such.  It will probably be a fairly complex
system by the time it is complete -- likely too complex to
make in-server implementation of it sensible or effective.
The particular algorithm chosen may well prove to be
application-dependent, which provides yet another reason to
keep it out of the Muq server proper, which is intended to
provide "mechanism, not policy" (to quote an X window system
catchphrase).

Most of the words documented in this section do not actually
correspond directly to Muq bytecode primitives; Instead,
they are essentially directives to the muf compiler to alter
the normal sequential flow of control in various ways, which
it does by synthesizing patterns of simpler bytecode
primitives.

It is traditional in Forth to allow the programmer great
flexibility, up to and including defining new control
structures and crashing the interpreter.  As a multi-user
system, Muq cannot allow users to crash the interpreter, but
it does allow users to define new control structures.  This
isn't currently (version -1.0.0) documented or fully
finalized; someone remind Cynbe to do so, sometime.

Muq muf uses curly braces to delimit the scope of control
structures, somewhat as C does:
@example
do@{ @dots{} @}
@end example
Since muf, unlike C, breaks source code up into tokens
simply based on whitespace, the presence or absence of
a blank is very significant in muf:  The above example
is @emph{not} equivalent to
@example
do @{ @dots{} @}
@end example

It is often important that certain cleanup operations be
done at the end of a given section of code, even if that
section should fail in some way.

For example, if one is doing a network file transfer, the
socket should be closed at the end, even if the tranfer
fails to complete normally for some reason.

Or if one has a session open to an X server, one should be
very careful to release resources allocated in the server at
the end of the session, to avoid having it gradually fill up
with unused garbage.

Almost every nontrivial application has invariants like
these which it is intended to maintain, but which must be
temporarily broken from time to time during processing: One
of the hallmarks of high-quality muf code is the careful
attention given to preserving all invariants in the face of
unexpected error conditions.

The Muq control construct designed for these cases is

@example
after@{ clause-1 @}alwaysDo@{ clause-2 @}
@end example

Muq goes to great lengths internally to guarantee that
clause-2 will always execute, even if the code in clause one
should do a divide-by-zero or attempt to do a @code{throw}
or @code{return} past us: It will silently interrupt the
error-recovery, throw, or return processing long enough for
clause-2 to execute, and then transparently resume the
interrupted processing.

Almost the sole exception to this rule is that if
@code{killJobMessily} is used to terminate the job
during execution of clause-1 or clause-2, no attempt is
made to execute (or complete execution of) clause-2:
the job is killed dead, instantly.  This ensures that
users and root always have @emph{some} way to kill a
runaway process: if Muq insisted on always running
clause-2 to completion, an accidental or malicious
recursion or infinite loop in clause-2 could result in
an immortal, cancerous process endlessly chewing up
system resources until the server crashed.

(This is, of course, a good reason to use
@code{killJobMessily} only as a last resort: one
should always first attempt to kill an unwanted job
with a friendly @code{killJob} signal, giving it a
fair chance to clean up after itself before exiting.)

What should happen if clause-1 does a fork?  This
leaves two jobs capable of executing clause-2, but
in general one wishes clause-2 to be executed
exactly once.

There are two obvious policies:  Have only the child
job execute clause-2, or have only the parent job
execute clause-2.  Since convincing examples exist
supporting each possibility, Muq provides both, via
the syntax

@example
afterChildDoes@{  clause-1 @}alwaysDo@{ clause-2 @}
afterParentDoes@{ clause-1 @}alwaysDo@{ clause-2 @}
@end example

The vanilla syntax

@example
after@{ clause-1 @}alwaysDo@{ clause-2 @}
@end example

is currently a synonym for the
@code{afterParentDoes@{}
syntax.

The @code{call@{@dots{}@}} syntaxis is the intended
mechanism for invoking functions which are passed as
arguments or plucked at runtime from the database.

Note: An older syntax of simply @code{call} still
exists.  It can be useful in exceptional cases where
you need and want to call a function of no
particular arity, as for example in a user shell.

When writing nontrivial code, one sometimes needs to abort a
fairly deeply nested set of function calls.

One way of handling this problem is by having each function
return a flag saying "yes, I'm aborting," or "no, I'm not
aborting," and then having every function-call check this
flag an conditionally propagate the abort.  However, code
written this way is tedious to code, ugly to read, and prone
to errors.  Code with the single purpose of implementing a
non-local exit winds up scattered all through the program,
which is poor separation of concerns and just plain poor
software design.

C solves this problem via @code{setjmp()} and
@code{longjmp().}  Lisp implements a similar but more
sophisticated utility via @code{catch} and @code{throw,}
recently adopted by @sc{ansi} Forth.  Muq implements a
similar @code{catch/throw} pair:

@example
anyconst catch@{ ... [ anyargs | anyconst ]throw ... @}
@end example

Catch accepts one @code{anyconst} argument: It only responds
to @code{]throw}s given a matching @code{anyconst} value.

(This makes selective @code{]throw}ing possible, in which a
@code{]throw} bypasses several @code{catch} clauses to reach
a preferred one deeper down on the execution stack.)

@code{Catch} then executes the brace-enclosed clause;  If the
clause complete normally, @code{catch} returns a @code{nil} value
on top of an empty block.

If a matching @code{]throw} is executed in the clause,
@code{catch} pushes a true value on top of the block
returned by @code{]throw.}

Algolic compilers (Algol, C, Pascal, Modula, Ada @dots{})
are traditionally big black boxes of functionality locked
away from the programmer.  Lisp and Forth compilers are
traditionally open frameworks which programmers are
encouraged to use and extend.  Muq @sc{muf} is implemented
in the latter spirit.

Specifically, Forth traditionally implements the compiler
using a standard architecture which is documented and
open to the programmer, and provides a keyword by which
the programmer may mark a particular function as being
intended to run at compiletime rather than at runtime.

When the compiler encounters an invocation of such a
function, it evaluates the function immediately in the
context of the partly-compiled program, rather than
assembling a call to invoke it at runtime.  In essence, the
programmer is allowed to dynamically extend the compiler.

Muq @sc{muf} defines a very different compileTime
architecture (since, again, it must prevent erroneous or
malicious code from crashing the interpreter), but provides
essentially the same facility: Any function which contains
the operator @code{compileTime} anywhere in its definition
compiles into an executable procedure with a special flag
set; When the @sc{muf} compiler encounters an invocation of
such a procedure, it evaluates the procedure immediately at
compiletime, rather than assembling a runtime call to it.
@end deffn

Since the compileTime architecture is not yet (version
-1.0.0) stably defined, no examples of this are given here.

Note: The @sc{compileTime} flag is ignored by the inserver
@sc{muf} compiler, which is the only compiler functional in
the -1.0.0 Muq release.

Note: This operator will probably be replaced by a
@code{define-macro:} operator in a future release.

The @code{for} construct is Muq @sc{muf}'s tool for interating a
specified number of times.

The "by" value should always be positive, and defaults to
one if not specified.

The "from" value defaults to zero if not specified.

The "upto" value specifies a limit which is to be reached:
The index variable may have this value on the final iteration.

The "below" value specifies a limit which is not to be reached:
The index variable must be below this value on the final iteration.

The "downto" value specifies a limit which is to be reached:
The index variable may have this value on the final iteration.

The "above" value specifies a limit which is not to be reached:
The index variable must be above this value on the final iteration.

If "downto" or "above" are supplied, the loop runs towards
smaller values, else it runs toward larger values.

The @code{foreach} construct is Muq @sc{muf}'s tool for
conveniently iterating over all public keys (and optionally
values) on an object:

@example
Stack:
makeIndex --> o
Stack:
101 --> o.a   102 --> o.b   103 --> o.c
Stack:
o foreach key val do@{ [ "%s:%d\n" key val | ]print , @}
a:101
b:102
c:103
Stack:
@end example

The @code{foreach} operator accepts one object argument, then
executes the given code clause once for each public key on the
object, setting the given @code{key} local variable succesively
to each key.

If the optional @code{val} local variable is also supplied,
it will be filled in with the corresponding value. If this
variable is not supplied, the values of the various keys are
not fetched, which may speed the loop somewhat.

The current implementation does not automatically store
changes to the @code{val} variable back to the given object.

four areas of an object: foreachHidden, foreachSystem and

The @code{if} operator pops one value off the stack; if it
is non-@code{nil}, the first clause is evaluated, otherwise
the second clause (if present) is evaluated.

(I find curly braces inesthetic in the muf

I am reluctant to introduce text macros into Muq: The
problem is that text macros tend to be very
language-specific, and Muq is intended to be a multi-lingual
programming environment.

Any significant accumulation of header files containing
important information recorded as text macros could quickly
lead to a maintainance nightmare of trying to translate
these header files into formats suitable for other languages
on the system, and the prospect of loss of access to such
header files would pose a significant disincentive to
experimentation with new languages on Muq.

Inline functions seem a more attractive alternative.  Inline
functions can do much of what macros are usually used for
with equal efficiency, while remaining much more language-
independent: There is no obvious reason inline functions
coded in Muq @sc{muf} cannot be called from Muq Lisp, and vice
versa.

It is intended that @sc{muf} functions be flagged as
inline-expandable simply by including the keyword
@code{pleaseInline} somewhere in their body -- presumably
normally at or near the beginning.

The @sc{muf} compiler is not required to inline such
functions, but it is permitted and encouraged to do so.

On each iteration, the @code{until} operator pops one value

otherwise execution continues normally past the

Sometimes one wants the loop-termination test in the middle
of the loop.  @code{do@{ @dots{} @} } constitutes an
infinite loop.

The @code{loopFinish} operator is just like the C @code{break}
operator: It terminates the loop tranferring control to the code
following the loop.

The @code{loopNext} operator is just like the C @code{continue}
operator: It transfers control to the top of the loop, beginning the
next iteration: It is useful for quickly dismissing uninteresting cases
in favor of proceeding immediately to the next iteration of the loop.

@example
Stack:
0 10 for i do@{ i 1 logand 1 = if [ "%d is odd\n" i | ]print , fi @}

The @code{withLockDo@{@dots{}@}} operator is the main Muq @sc{muf}
explicit synchronization mechanism:  The canonical code for
sequencing access to a small db by multiple jobs is

@example
makeIndex --> obj      ( Create db object proper.              )
makeLock --> obj.lock  ( Create a lock (semaphore) for db.     )
...                     (                                       )
obj.lock withLockDo@{   ( Block until we aquire the lock.       )
    ...                 ( Fiddle with the db.                   )

@end example

@xref{Class Lock}.
@xref{popLockframe}.
@xref{pushLockframe}.

Note that Muq streams provide implicit synchronization.
@xref{Class MessageStream}.

Fine point:
Attempting to acquire a lock which the job already
holds is essentially a no-op:  Execution continues
without pause.  The only effect is that a null
stackframe is pushed, to keep the subsequent
@code{popLockframe} instruction happy.

Fine point:
Since the point of a lock is that it can be held
by only one job at a time, when a job holding a
lock does a @code{copyJob}, only one of the resulting
two jobs should hold the lock.  By default, this
will be the parent.  If you wish to specify which
job should inherit the lock, you may use the syntax

@example
withChildLockDo@{ ... @}
@end example

to specify that the child should inherit the lock,
or

withParentLockDo@{ ... @}

The @code{]withRestartDo@{@dots{}@}} operator is
the current Muq @sc{muf} surface syntax for
executing code under the control of a specified
restart.  (@xref{Restarts}.)

The @sc{muf} syntax for establishing a restart is

@example
[ :name 'halt-and-catch-fire
  :function  :: halt-and-catch-fire ;
  :testFunction nil
  :interactiveFunction nil
  :reportFunction "Halt and catch fire"
  :data "<any user data value whatever>"
| ]withRestartDo@{
  @dots{}
@}
@end example

@noindent
where @code{nil} properties may be omitted.

The @code{:reportFunction} may be either a string, or
else a function accepting a stream and printing a
string to that stream.

Restarts intended for interactive use should have a
@code{:reportFunction} (which may be merely a string).
If @code{:function} takes no arguments, then @code{:interactiveFunction}
may be @code{nil}, otherwise @code{:function} should accept a single block
of arguments, and @code{:interactiveFunction} should be a function
which generates an appropriate argument block, typically by use of
the @code{queryFor*} functions (@pxref{user i/o functions}).

Note: The @code{:function} value needs to be of arity
@code{@{ -> @}} if the restart is to be invoked via
@code{invokeRestart}, and of arity @code{@{ [] -> @}}
if the restart is to be invoked via
@code{]invokeRestart}.  In particular, this means that
restart @code{:function}s exiting via a nonlocal
@code{goto} will usually need to be forced to the
appropriate arity.  Example:

@example
withTag my-tag do@{
    [   :function :: @{ -> ! @} 'my-tag goto ;
        :name 'my-restart
    | ]withRestartDo@{
        ...
    @}
@}
@end example

See @ref{Muq Events} for a general discussion of the
event system.

The @code{:data} value is a hook intended to be used
by user code to attach any desired information to a
restart: It may later be used by user-defined handlers
when selecting a restart to invoke.  It is ignored by
all software in the current standard Muq distribution.

The @code{]withHandlersDo@{@dots{}@}} operator is
the current Muq @sc{muf} surface syntax for
executing code under the control of specified
event handlers.  (@xref{Handlers}.)

(The @code{]withHandlerDo@{@dots{}@}} operator is
a synonym for @code{]withHandlersDo@{@dots{}@}}.)

The syntax is

@example
[  event0  handler0
   event1  handler1
   ...
| ]withHandlersDo@{ ... @}
@end example

where:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Each @emph{event} must be an instance of Class
Event (@pxref{makeEvent}).

@item
Each @emph{handler} must be a @{ [] -> [] @} function
accepting a block describing the event,
and returning that block unchanged if it
returns at all.  (A handler which resolves the
event will normally not return.)
@end itemize

To prevent recursive handler disasters, when any
of the specified handlers is invoked, it is run in
a context in which the given handler bindings are
all effectively dis-established.  (Handler
bindings established by other
@code{]withHandlersDo@{} statements are of
course completely unaffected by this, even if they
specify the same handler functions.)

Example:  This calls a function @code{fn} with
a handler established that counts warnings.
Since the handler then returns normally, normal
warning handling is not otherwise affected:

@example
0 --> *warnings-seen*
[ .err.warning
  :: @{ [] -> [] ! @} ++ *warnings-seen* ;
| ]withHandlersDo@{
  fn
@}
@end example

Example: This prints a custom message on divide by zero,
then (by simply returning) lets the usual handler(s) take
over:

@example
[ .err.divisionByZero
  :: @{ [] -> [] ! @}
    "-Real- hackers don't divide by zero!\n" ,
  ;

The syntax is

@noindent
where @emph{tags} is a list of zero or more @code{goto}
target labels, and @emph{body} is the code scope in which

If only one tag is used, the @code{withTag} synonym to
@code{withTags} may be used.

This construct is a multiway branch corresponding to the
Pascal @code{case} and C @code{switch} statements, except
that the constants may be any values, including strings.
(I've frequently wished that C allowed string keys in
@code{switch}!) The @sc{muf} version also has the advantage
of being able to return a value, unlike either the C or
Pascal versions.  (Ansi Forth has a multiway branch also,
but its semantics seem twisted enough to cause continual
problems for novice programmers; After some thought, I
decided to break new ground.)

@example
Stack:
: xlt @{ $ -> $ @} case@{ on: 1 "one" on: 2 "two" else: "many" @} ;
Stack:
1 xlt
Stack: "one"
pop 2 xlt
Stack: "two"
pop 3 xlt
Stack: "many"
@end example

The @code{case@{} operator pops one value off the stack
and compares it with all provided @code{on:} constants until
it finds a match.  If it finds a match, it executes the
associated code clause; otherwise, it executes the
@code{else:} code clause, if present.
@end deffn

The current @sc{muf} compilers produce code which simply
scans all @code{on:} clauses in order until a match is
found: It may be wise to put the most frequently used cases
first if speed is an issue.

Note that, unlike C, the @sc{muf} @code{case@{} statement
does not require that clauses be separated by @code{break}
operators.  This feature of C tends to cause obscure bugs,
to puzzle newcomers (particularly those trained on Pascal),
and to add unneeded verbosity: Try translating the above
one-liner into C.

@code{@@$s.actingUser} to the owner of the currently
executing function.  Upon exit from the construct, the
original value of @code{@@$s.actingUser} is restored.

Functions using this construct should be very carefully
written and do a very clearly defined task: If you make a
mistake, you may wind up granting everyone full access to
all your objects, the ability to send mail under your name,
and so forth.

Functions using this construct and owned by root should be
@emph{extremely} carefully written and do an
@emph{extremely} clearly defined, simple task: Every such
function is part of the "security kernel" of your system,
which is only as secure as the least secure function of this
kind.  It only takes @emph{one} carelessly written one-line
@code{asMeDo@{@dots{}@}} function owned by root to
eliminate all security and privacy on a complete Muq system.

On any well-administered Muq system, there should be at
least one administrator who knows exactly where all the
root-owned @code{asMeDo} functions are, exactly what each
one does, and who either makes or is informed of all
modifications to these functions.  I considered having the
server force all such functions to be stored on some
particular object, but decided this was inconsistent with
the design goal of a policy-free server.  I do think you
would be wise to pick some spot like @code{.u["root"].asMeDo}
and in it keep a pointer to all such functions.

This is a fairly esoteric internal function.  Muq internally uses 21-bit
fields to identify database files, but externally uses an @sc{ascii}
representation of this number in the filename, a six-character string
consisting approximately of a string of four all lower-case (user db
file) or all upper-case (system db file) alphabetic characters, usually
padded with a couple of dashes.

This function converts from the string representation to the integer
representation.  Invalid strings are silently coerced to something
reasonable.

For readability (and to avoid "------" being ambiguous) database id zero
(the root db) is special-cased as "ROOTDB".

@subsection db functions overview

The state of an individual Muq server is stored in a single @code{.muq}
which is logically separated into a number of "databases", typically
one per user plus one for each major system library or
dataset.  (These may be thought of as being roughly parallel
to the separate disk partitions of a unix file system, with
their ability to be independently mounted and unmounted.)

These logical databases may be "exported" as independent host files,
which are given the extension @code{.db} to distinguish them from
the master @code{.muq} server state file.

The resulting @code{.db} files may then in turn be "imported" back
into the master Muq @code{.muq} file at a later date, or may be
transported to other systems and imported into servers there.

This means that @code{.db} files may serve as a universal
interchange format within the Muq world: Any combination of
code and data, no matter how large or complex, may be this
means be passed from one system to another and there
accessed without the usual inconveniences of going through
an obscuring layer of API access functions: The installed
code and data is directly accessable without further ado.

This is a distinct improvement on the typical contemporary
arrangement of hundreds of different datafile formats, each
of which addresses only a narrow range of datastructures
(and typically no code at all), and each of which requires
use of a different, clumsy API in order to gain access to
the file contents:  With luck, this reduced cost of
code and data interchange within the Muq world will lead
directly to a higher level of cooperative interchange.



@c
@node  db pragmatics, rootMakeDb, db functions overview, db functions
@subsection db pragmatics

Each db is named internally by a 21-bit number:  Internally
within server, every 64-bit logical pointer references an
object includes this number.

For human consumption, these numbers are usually encoded as
four-letter names, such as "joe" or "LISP".  By a convention
supported by the Muq server, uppercase names are used for
standard system libraries, and lowercase names are used for
local users and libraries:  By respecting this convention
on your system, you minimize chances of incompatibilities
between your local server state and future standard
libraries which may become available.

The set of databases installed in a given server may be listed out
from the @sc{muf} commandline:

@example

The above system has no user accounts, consisting almost
entirely of system libraries:

@enumerate
@item ANSI
A small experimental library of ansi-terminal cursor
positioning (&tc) functions.

@item DBUG
The Muq debugger.

@item DICT
Lists of words 1024 long, used by Muq password routines.

@item DIFI
Constants and functions for the Diffie-Hellman public key
support code.

@item GEST
Db used to hold known users on other systems -- "guests".

@item KEYW
Db used to hold system keywords -- @code{:xyzzy} in @sc{muf}
notation.

@item LISP
Db used to hold the lisp compiler and runtimes.

@item LNED
Db used to hold a small experimental line editor.

@item MUC
Db used to hold the Multi-User C compiler, shell and runtimes.

@item MUF
Db used to hold the Multi-User Forth compilers, shells and
runtimes -- this holds the bulk of the core Muq support
softcode.

@item MUFV
Db intended to hold all the variables needed by the @sc{muf}
db, so that the @sc{muf} can be read-only.  There are
probably still variables in the @sc{muf} db.

@item OMSH
Db holding the Micronesia "oldmud" user shell code.

@item OMUD
Db holding the Micronesia "oldmud" worldkit code.

@item PUB
I forget!

@item QNET
Db holding the Muqnet transparent networking support code.

@item QNETA
Db intended to hold the mutable data for the Muqnet db, so
as to allow @sc{qnet} to eventually be read-only.

@item RMUD
Db parts of the "oldmud" worldkit which need to be root
privileged.  In principle, the other oldmud libraries should
be installable owned by an unprivileged account, although
this is not yet done and probably not yet possible in
practice.

@item ROOTDB
This is the root db for the server, corresponding to the
root partition @code{/} on a unix filesystem:  It is
deliberately given a six-letter name (otherwise impossible)
to emphasize its specialness.  (The actual decimal db number
is zero.)  Since it is risky to modify this db, and
impossible to dismount it, it should be kept simple,
stable and small.

@item TASK
This db contains the "task" support logic used by the
Micronesia worldkit to handle Muqnet callback archiving
and invocation.

@item TLNT
This db contains the @sc{telnet} protocol support code and
data, used to support user telnet logins.
@end enumerate

Here is an occasionally useful facility:  The 'private'
propdir on db objects lists all existing objects in that db.
This means that you may do

@example
root:
.db["MUF"] lsh
@end example

to list absolutely everything in the @sc{muf} db -- every
string, every object, every vector, every bignum, every
b-tree block, everything.

This is usually not a good idea!

But writing loops similar to that used by @code{lsh} can
be a useful way of gathering statistics on space
consumption:
  
@example
root: 
0 -> symbols   .db["MUF"] foreachHidden key do@{ key symbol? if ++ symbols fi @}   "symbols=" , symbols , "\n" ,
symbols=1638
root: 
@end example


Here is a simple example of creating a new db, creating a
package inside it, creating a value in that package,
exporting the db as a Muq @code{.db} file, removing the db from the server, and
then importing the @code{.db} file back into the server to
recreate the db and its contents:

@example
root: 
[ "mydb" | rootMakeDb ]pop            ( Create a db 'mydb' )
root: 
[ "mypkg" .db["mydb"] | ]inPackage    ( Create a package inside mydb )
mypkg: 
13 1300 makeVector --> myvec          ( Create a 1300-slot vector in mypkg )
mypkg: 
"root" inPackage                      ( Return to home package )
root: 
[ .db["mydb"] | rootExportDb ]pop     ( Write 'mydb' contents to a host .db file )
root: 
[ .db["mydb"] | rootRemoveDb ]pop     ( Remove 'mydb' db from main server .muq file )
root: 
[ "mydb"      | rootImportDb ]pop     ( Read .db hostfile in, recreating 'mydb'. )
root: 
mypkg::myvec[0]                       ( Verify 'myvec' exists in 'mypkg' in 'mydb'. )

Create a new db.  The input @code{dbId} may be a string,
an integer, or nil.  If it is nil, the server picks an
unused name for the db.  If it is a string or integer,
the server accepts them as name hints and tries to
assign the new db a name as close as possible to the
hint.

The return value is the dbId actually selected, as
a string:  It may be used to index the global
@code{.db[]} index to locate the actual created
db object.

Note that @code{rootMakeUser} creates a new db, owned
by the new user, as part of its operation:

This function accepts a db and writes its contents out as
a host @code{.db} file.

The usual way to obtain the required db object is to
index into the internal @code{.db[]} index:

@example
root:
[ .db["MUF"] | rootExportDb ]pop
@end example

@end defun

@c

@subsection rootImportDb
@defun rootImportDb @{ [dbId] -> [dbId] @}
@display
@exdent file: job.t
@exdent package: muf
@exdent status: alpha
@end display

This function accepts a db designation, either as a
(typically four-letter) string or as an integer, and
attempts to import the corresponding host @code{.db}
file:

@example
root:
[ "xyz" | rootImportDb ]pop
root: 
@end example

The above command will search for host files under the names
@example
muq-CURRENT-xyz.db
muq-CURRENT-xyz.db.gz
muq-CURRENT-xyz.db.lzo
muq-CURRENT-xyz.db.bz2
@end example
and load the first one found, uncompressing as needed (presuming the appropriate
decompression program can be located).

If the imported db contains pointers to objects in other dbs
which existed on the exporting system but are missing from
the current server, such pointers will be replaced by
@code{nil}s.  If these pointers occurred in critical spots,
these substitutions may cripple index or other
datastructures in the db, or even crash the server later
on.

Also, it is relatively easy for the imported db to forge
pointers to objects it would not normally be able to
access.

In general, Muq is not currently intended to be secure
or stable in the face of importation of maliciously
constructed .db files:  You should import .db files
only from reasonably trusted sources.

A future version of this function should probably optionally
accept a full host filename as input argument.

If the db in question already exists within the server,
you must use @code{rootReplaceDb} instead of
@code{rootImportDb}.  (It would be easy enough to combine
these into one function, but keeping them separate may
reduce the incidence of unfortunate accidents.)

@subsection rootRemoveDb
@defun rootRemoveDb @{ [db] -> [] @}
@display
@exdent file: job.t
@exdent package: muf
@exdent status: alpha
@end display

This function removes the given db from the server state,
which essentially means removing all the information
nassociated with that db from the currently open
@code{.muq} file:

@example
root:
[ .db["mydb"] | rootRemoveDb ]pop
root:
@end example

All references from other dbs to objects in the deleted
db will be replaced by @code{nil}s:  If there are such
references in critical spots, these new @code{nil}s
may (say) cripple an index object or even crash the server.

The implementation attempts to catch and prevent common
cases of this, and will likely be upgraded to catch
additional cases in the future, but caution and good sense
are advised.

If you are primarily trying to upgrade a db, it is usually a
bad idea to do @code{rootRemoveDb} followed immediately by
@code{rootImportDb} because this sequence is guaranteed to
break (replace by @code{nil}) all pointers from outside the
db into it: It is better to do @code{rootReplaceDb}, which
will leave these pointers intact if reasonably possible.

This function replaces the contents of the given db with
those taken from the corresponding host @code{.db} file.

The result is similar to that obtainable by doing a
@code{rootRemoveDb} followed immediately by a matching
@code{rootImportDb}, except that doing a
@code{rootReplaceDb} instead will usually leave intact
pointers from outside the db into it, whereas the former
sequence is guaranteed to set all such pointers to
@code{nil}.

@example
root:
[ .db["mydb"] | rootReplaceDb ]pop
root:
@end example

The @code{rootReplaceDb} may be used to either upgrade
or roll back ("downgrade"?) a db:  It doesn't care which.

The replacement @code{.db} file must currently have (in the
case of the above example) one of the names

@example
muq-CURRENT-xyz.db
muq-CURRENT-xyz.db.gz
muq-CURRENT-xyz.db.lzo
muq-CURRENT-xyz.db.bz2
@end example

A future version of this function will probably allow
specification of an arbitrary host filename (if not
pathname) for the @code{.db} file.

The db functions should be used with caution.

Removing a db from the server can disrupt datastructures and running
processes due to the suddenly missing objects.  The server tries to
catch simple, common cases of this, but there remain many ways of
crashing or crippling the server this way.

Installing a db is a bit like injecting fluid into the body with
a hypodermic needle:  The normal system defenses are bypassed, and
various security or reliability problems may result.  For instance,
it is fairly easy to craft a malicious .db file which will forge
pointers to data which would not normally be available to a user.
A .db file may also overwrite a system package pointer with an
inappropriate new package, subverting existing in-db software.

Good handling of persistent data and related issues is Muq's
greatest single strength, and future releases will continue
to focus upon this.

Improvements which I expect to introduce roughly in the year
2000-2001 timeframe include:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Supporting objects up through about 64Mbytes in size -- current
limit is 64K.

@item
Supporting variable size objects -- currently size of an
object is fixed at creation, at least in terms of the
fundamental vm.t diskbase layer facilities.

@item
Mapping @code{.muq} files into memory.  This will speed
db open and close (particularly of uncompressed dbs) and
somewhat speed up disk I/O on large objects, but primarily
it will enable the following.

@item
Communicating with other processes via shared-memory access
to @code{.muq} files.  This will allow high-bandwidth
communication with a variety of helper applications, such
as lapack operations and sound, still and video
I/O and transformations via large shared arrays.

@item
Mounting (as opposed to importing) @code{.db} files, in
particular large, static read-only @code{.db} files.  This
would be an appropriate way of making large datasets such
as MRI voxel datasets, gene sequence data, image libraries
and such available to softcode without having to actually
copy them into the master @code{.muq} file and duplicate
their contents at each backup of the @code{.muq} file.

@item
More sophisticated garbage collection -- this is critical
to working effectively with datasets larger than physical
memory workingset.  Options include going to a multi-generation
garbage collection scheme, going to an incremental scheme
-- likely based on Dijkstra's three-color algorithm -- or
a combination of the two.  Ideally, garbage collection
pauses should become too short to be noticable to
interactive users doing 3D graphics &tc.

@item
True incremental backup, so that (ideally, at least) the
server continues to run without noticable pauses during
backup operations.

@end itemize

In a slightly longer timeframe, it would be good to
investigate input journalling, so as to be able to
back up and reproduce a run exactly -- very handy
for debugging, among other things.

A good notation makes things look simple by making common
operations concise.  It is good programming practice to make
heavy use of function definitions @footnote{The inventor of
Forth insists that no function should be longer than two
lines!}.

In any event, Forth does an admirable job of making function
definitions simple, cheap and concise, and Muq @sc{muf} attempts
to preserve that heritage:

@example
Stack:
: hi "Hello!\n , ;
Stack:
hi hi hi
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Stack:
: thrice 3 * ;
Stack:
13 thrice
Stack: 39
thrice
Stack: 117
thrice
Stack: 351
@end example

The first word after the colon is the name of the new
function; The remaining words up until the @code{;} form the
definition of the function: Once the function is defined,
entering its name is about the same as entering all the code
in its body.

Muq @sc{muf} allows @code{defineWord:} as a synonym for
@code{:}, regarding the latter as an abbreviation of the
former.  Ada programmers and lawyers may prefer the former
name @emph{grin} @dots{}


@c
@node  Arity declarations, Nested functions, Named functions, function definition syntax
@subsection Arity declarations
@cindex Arity declaration
@findex @{

It is traditional Forth programming practice to include at
the start of each function a comment giving the number of
arguments it accepts and returns.  (This sort of
documentation is a good habit in any language.)

Muq @sc{muf} continues this tradition, but extends it by
making the declarations in a syntax understandable to the
muf compiler, as do most modern languages other than Forth:

@example
Stack:
: x @{ $ $ -> $ @} * ;
Stack:
2 3 x
Stack: 6
@end example

The arity declaration is enclosed in curly braces and
contains one '$' for each input parameter, followed by an
arrow, followed by one dot for each value returned.

Muq distinguishes single arguments from blocks of arguments:

@example
Stack:
: |double   @{ [] -> [] @}   |for i do@{ i 2 * -> i @}   ;
Stack:
5 seq[
Stack: [ 0 1 2 3 4 |
|double
Stack: [ 0 2 4 6 8 |
@end example

The arity declaration contains one @code{[]} for each block
read, and one for each block returned.  Block arguments must
in each case precede nonblock arguments.


@c
@node  Nested functions, Recursive functions, Arity declarations, function definition syntax
@subsection Nested functions
@cindex Nested functions

Many Algolic languages, such as Pascal, allow functions to
be declared inside other functions, so as to be visible only
inside that function.  The Muq @sc{muf} compiler also allows
this:

@example
Stack:
: print2 -> n   : p -> i [ "%d\n" i | ]print , ;   n p n p ;
Stack:
13 print2
13

Forth has traditionally not handled recursion nicely,
functions being disallowed from calling themselves

Muq @sc{muf} allows this sort of recursion quite naturally.
Here is the venerable factorial function:

@example
Stack:
: fact @{ $ -> $ @} -> i   i 1 = if  i  else  i 1- fact i *  fi ;
Stack:

The practical power of a software system is largely a
function of the freedom with which a basis set of
pre-existing functions can be combined to span a
combinatorial space of possible computations: The search for
increased programming power has driven a relentless trend
toward ever more flexible ways of combining ever shorter
functions, currently reaching some sort of apogee in the
functional programming community.

A natural result of this trend to shorter functions used as
building blocks in large computations is that many functions
are created simply to be immediately passed to other
functions.  Requiring that such functions be given names
only contributes to syntantic clutter.

The Muq @sc{muf} syntax for declaring an anonymous function
is identical to that for a named function, except that a
double colon replaces the single colon, the name is dropped,
and the compiled function is left on the stack:

@example
Stack:
:: "Hi mom!\n" , ;
Stack: <c-fn _>

Hi mom!

Note: This example also doesn't work quite right on Muq

@subsection Thunks
@cindex Thunks

When the result of a computation depends on a changing
context, it is often sensible to delay computation of a
result until the last possible instant, so as to produce a
result as up-to-date as possible.

If the code using the value is not aware that it is runtime
computed, however, this can often be difficult to arrange,
and can result in a maze of twisty little functions once it
@emph{has} been arranged.

Muq @sc{muf}'s answer to this design problem is the
@dfn{thunk:} A chunk of code which may be freely copied
around and stored in variables, properties and so forth, but
which will be transparently evaluated and replaced by its
result as soon as any computation depending on its value is
attempted@footnote{The name 'thunk' comes from the
implementation of call-by-name semantics in Algol68, where
the name purportedly derived from the notion that the
function didn't have to think about the value because the
compiler had already thunk about it@dots{}}.

Thunks have the same syntax as anonymous functions, except
that the double colon is replaced by @code{star-colon}:
@example

Stack:
*: 2 3 + ;
Stack: <thunk>
1+
Stack: 6
@end example
Implementation of thunks presents some interesting security
problems @dots{} @emph{grin}.


@c
@node  Promises, job control functions, Thunks, function definition syntax
@subsection Promises

Promises are quite similar to thunks, but are intended to
implement context-free computations@footnote{The 'promise'
nomenclature derives from Scheme.}.  Since the result of the
computation doesn't depend on when it is performed, there is
no reason to waste @sc{cpu} time computing it more than
twice, so promises are guaranteed to evaluate at most once,
subsequent invocations merely returning a saved copy of the
original result:

@example
Stack:
1: 2 3 + ;
Stack: <thunk>
1+
Stack: 6
@end example

Promises are completely unimplemented as of Muq version -1.0.0.

The Muq multitasking model deliberately sticks fairly close
to that of unix, both to avoid borrowing trouble in a tricky
area by adopting a well-tested design, and to facilitate
transfer of user expertise between Muq and unix.

A single flow of control within Muq -- a program counter
plus a stack, if you will -- is termed a @dfn{job}.  A job
corresponds loosely to a unix @emph{process}, except that it
lacks a separate address space; A unix @emph{thread} is in
that respect a closer analogy.

Several jobs performing a single conceptual task (much like
a unix pipeline) are grouped together into a @dfn{jobset},
corresponding to a unix @emph{process group}.  Jobsets
provide us with a convenient way of (for example) stopping
or killing all of the jobs in a pipeline, something which
might otherwise be tedious and error-prone.

The group of jobsets executing for a single user connected
via a single login are grouped toegether into a
@dfn{session}, corresponding to a unix @emph{session}.
Sessions provide us with a convenient way of killing all the
jobs associated with a login if the network connection is
lost, and a place to record which jobset is currently titled
to read and write interactively to the user -- the
@dfn{foreground jobset}.

Muq jobs communicate and are controlled by a signal
mechanism closely modelled on the unix signal mechanism, as
well as via message streams which are loosely modelled on
unix pipes, and via the db, which even more loosely
corresponds to the unix filesystem.

Note: Muq signals are likely to change substantially as Muq
is brought more into line with the CommonLisp
exception-handling standard.

One possible use is when busy-waiting on
some other job:  Doing a @code{switchJob}
after each check can minimize wasted CPU
time and maximize the other job's chance
of completing the task.

In general, of course, use of busy-waiting is

which does a @code{copyJobset} and then runs the child,
yielding something closer to the unix semantics.

It is currently implemented as:

The @code{pauseJob} operator is a simple convenience

It is currently implemented as:

@example

@exdent status: alpha
@end display

The @code{pidToJob} function accepts an integer pid
such as displayed by @code{pj}, and returns a corresponding
job.  (Pids are assigned sequentially from the global
counter @code{.muq$s.nextPid}, which means it is
possible but normally unlikely for a two running jobs to
have the same pid.  Pids are stored as @code{job$s.name}.)

It is currently implemented as:
@example
: pidToJob @{ $ -> $ @} -> pid

    ( Generate block of all non-killed )
    ( jobs owned by current user:      )
   me$s.psQueue jobQueueContents[

        ( Over all entries in block: )

This convenience function calls @code{pidToJob} on
integer arguments while leaving other arguments
unchanged;  It is useful in implementing functions
which indifferently accept either a job or a pid
as input.

It is currently implemented as:

    pid integer? if   pid pidToJob -> pid   fi

The @code{queueJob} operator removes @code{job} from
whatever job-queues it is currently in, and then
inserts it into @code{jobQueue}.  Moving a job into
some arbitrary jobQueue is one way to stop it from
running.  (It may get woken by signals, however.)
Moving it into a ``run'' jobQueue (for example,
@code{me$s.runQueue1}) is a way to start it running
again.

(Note: Since there are actually multiple run-queues
for each user, and a job should always go in the queue
matching its priority, the @code{queueJob} operator
silently puts the job in the right jobQueue, even if
it is not the one specified.)

@example
Stack:
makeJobQueue --> q
Stack:
copyJob dup if --> j j q queueJob else pop 2000 sleepJob nil endJob fi
Stack:
j me$s.runQueue0 queueJob
Stack:
@end example

Here, the @code{copyJob} line leaves job @code{j} in
suspended animation in jobQueue @code{q}, and the
next line releases it and lets it run to completion.
You can use the @code{printJobs} (@code{pj}) command
to observe jobstate.

The @code{sleepJob} operator puts the currently executing
job to sleep for @code{n} milliseconds, by setting
@@$s.sleepUntilMillisec to the current date plus @code{n} and then
moving it to the .etc.doz job queue:

@example
Stack:
10000 sleepJob "*yawn* Morning already?\n" ,
*yawn* Morning already?
Stack:
@end example

Unlike unix, sleeping jobs sent signals will process them
and then return to sleep until the designated time; I expect
this will make coding simpler for novice programmers.

The @code{killJobMessily} operator is intended to allow
killing any Muq job, even one run wild, refusing signals,
or looping in @code{after@{@}alwaysDo@{}@} clauses.  Since
it shuts down jobs without allowing @code{after@{@}alwaysDo@{}@}
clauses to execute, and hence can leave damaged datastructures
behind, it should be used only as a last resort.

@subsection keyval functions overview

A primary Muq metaphor is that of objects viewed as sets of
keyValue pairs.  In essence, objects are two-column
relations, the relation being one of the most fundamental
and flexible mathematical structures.  The restriction to
two columns is mildly inelegant, but not serious given that
the value column may be a vector; From a relational
perspective, the Muq implementation restriction to only
indexing on the key column is considerably more serious.

This section documents the fundamental Muq primitives for
manipulating the contents of objects.  Higher-level
facilities such as the @code{for} operator are built on top
of these, and will frequently be found to be more convenient
that using the prims directly.

Five parallel sets of primitives are provided, one set each
for the five sets of keyVal pairs on Muq objects: public,
hidden, system, admins.  We document the public
set in detail, then briefly list the other sets.

Note: Muq version -2.9.0 @code{getKey?} does not support
searching of objects.

The @code{getKey?} function may also be used to search
vectors and stacks for a given value, returning the
corresponding key (offset).  Vectors are searched starting
at offset zero, stacks are searched starting at the top.

This function does nothing that could not be done equally
easily in muf, but it puts the inner loop down in C, hence
may run a couple of orders of magnitude faster.

The @code{getKeysByPrefix[} function takes an object and
a string, and returns all public keys on the object which
start with the given string.  If any key matches the string
exactly, only that key is returned, even if other keys have
the string as a prefix.

This is intended to be useful for command
interpreters which allow abbreviation of commands to any
unique prefix:  The presumption is that an exact match
will be executed, but a multiple matches will result in
querying the user to select one of the alternatives.

This search could easily be coded in @sc{muf},
but can run much faster in C:

@example
makeIndex --> o
Stack:
1 --> o.a   1 --> o.ba   1 --> o.bb   1 --> o.c

The @code{getNextKey?} function takes an object and

Stack: 
o "ba" getNextKey?

A @dfn{List}, in the computer science sense of the term,
consists of a sequence of cells, each of which has two
pointers, one to a value, one to the next cell in the list:

@example
           +--------------+
List  -->  |   car     -------------> first value
           |--------------|
           |   cdr   |    |
           +-------- | ---+
                     |
                     V
           +--------------+
           |   car     -------------> second value
           |--------------|
           |   cdr   |    |
           +-------- | ---+
                     |
                     V
           +--------------+
           |   car     -------------> third value
           |--------------|
           |   cdr        |
           +--------------+
@end example

The List data structure is logically a binary tree (or graph
-- the pointers are permitted to form loops) but is usually
interpreted as a sequence.  Since the values may themselves
be Lists, arbitrary logical tree structures may easily be
constructed.

Lists are used very heavily in classical artificial
intelligence programming and such offshoots as expert
systems and functional programming languages.

Muq will eventually have a full complement of List
functions, but for now has just the following (partly
because many others are more appropriately coded in-db).

List cells are logically vectors of length two, but it is
worth making them a different data type, if only to
facilitate more appropriate prettyprinting of List
structures.  In additiona, CommonLisp requires that they be
separate data types.

The @code{]} function constructs a List from a given
set of arguments:

@example
Stack:
[ 1 2 3 ]l --> lst
Stack: 
lst first
Stack: 1
lst second
Stack: 1 2
lst third
Stack: 1 2 3
@end example

This is the closest @sc{muf} comes to Lisp's @code{'(1 2 3)}
notation for quoted lists.

Note that no '|' is used, that such lists may be nested,
and that (unlike quoted lists in Lisp) all the arguments
are evaluated, and may in fact be arbitrary expressions.

Thus, to construct a list of symbols, you must do

@example
Stack:
[ 'a 'b 'c ]
@end example

instead of merely

@example
Stack:
[ a b c ]
@end example

@xref{list}.

The similar @code{]v} function builds a vector rather
than a list.

The related @code{]i16} @code{]i32} @code{]f32} and @code{]f64} functions
build vectors specialized to containing (respectively) shorts, ints,
floats and doubles.

@example

@end example

@end defun

Modern languages often use more logical names like
@code{head} or @code{first} for this function.

Historical note: @code{car} stands for "Contents of Address
Register", referring to the machine instruction used to
implement this in the first Lisp, on an IBM 704 at MIT in
the late 1950s.)

This function is usually pronounced "could'er".

The @code{cons} function takes two values and constructs a

@example
Stack:
"a" "d" cons -> cell
Stack: 
cell car   cell cdr
Stack: "a" "d"
@end example

The name is short for "construct", since it constructs a
@code{cons} cell, the basic unit of storage in classical
lisp systems.

List cells are often called "cons cells", since they are
constructed by @code{cons}, or simply "conses", and the
process of constructing them is often called "consing".
@end defun

@quotation
It is possible to implement arbitrary programs using only
@code{cons} to modify memory; This train of thought leads to
the pure-functional programming community.  If this
intrigues you, you might grab a Haskell implementation from
cs.yale.edu or join the mailing list via
haskell-request@@cs.yale.edu.
@end quotation

You may sometimes wish to allocate a cons cell
on the stack instead of on the heap:  The function
@code{ephemeralCons} will do this.  For brevity,
it is also available under the synonym @code{econs}.
The usual cautions pertaining to ephemerals

cadr       Same as car cdr
cdar       Same as cdr car
...        ...

The @code{append} function returns a list which is the
concatenation of listA and listB.  All the cells in listA
are copied; listB is shared.  (Thus, @code{a nil append} is
an antique way of copying list @code{a}.)

@example

An @dfn{association list} is a list of cells containing
key/val pairs in their car/cdr slots:

@example
Stack:
[ key0 val0 cons   key1 val1 cons   key2 val2 cons ]l   --> list
@end example

Association lists are frequently used in traditional Lisp
programming to remember keyval associations, and typically
modified nondestructively by pushing and popping new keyval
cells at the start of the list.

The @code{assoc} function takes an association list and a
key, a returns the first keyval cell containing that key, if
any, else @code{nil}.  Thus, you must take the @code{cdr} of
the returned value to find the actual value associated with
the key.

If no matching key is found, @code{nil} is returned.

The choice of return value may see a bit odd.  One
advantage of this arrangement is that it makes it
easy to distinguish between failure to find the
key, and finding that the key has a value of @code{nil}.

@example
Stack:
[ 'k' 'v' cons   'K' 'V' cons ]l   --> list
Stack:
'k' list assoc cdr
Stack: 'v'
pop 'K' list assoc cdr

The @sc{muf} @code{mapc} function is named and patterned

It provides a simple way of applying a function to many sets

The @code{mapc} function accepts a block of lists and a
function, which must accept as many arguments as there are
lists in the block.  On the first call to the given
function, it is passed the first element in each of
the given lists.  On the second call, it recieves the
second element from each list.  This continues until
one or more of the lists run out of elements:

second element from each list.  This continues until one or
more of the lists run out of elements.

The lists returned from the successive calls are combined
with @code{nconc} and returned as the final result.

The @code{mapcon} function accepts a block of lists and a
function, which must accept as many arguments as there are
lists in the block, and return a list.  On the first call to
the given function, it is passed the first cons cell (not
element!) in each of the given lists.  On the second call,
it recieves the second cons cell from each list.  This
continues until one or more of the lists run out of
elements.

The lists returned from the successive calls are combined
with @code{nconc} and returned as the final result.

@code{mapl} does not either:  It is used purely for

The @sc{muf} @code{member?} function searches a list for a

else the first cons cell containing the given value:

@example
Stack:

It is currently defined as:

The @sc{muf} @code{nconc} function @emph{destructively}
joins two lists:  The last cons cell in the first list
is changed to point to the first cons cell in the

Stack:
list first  list second  list third  list fourth
Stack: 'a' 'b' 'c' 'd'
@end example

This looks much like the @code{append} function
(@pxref{append}) but is much more dangerous, since it
modifies an existing list instead of constructing a new one:
@code{nconc} is an efficiency hack to avoid allocating new
list cells.  Use it only if you really need to.

The name comes from CommonLisp: 'conc' for 'concatenate',
prefixed by the 'n' which signals a dangerous function
modifying existing lists.  (Think of as as n-for-nuke.)

Each Muq job ("thread") has two stacks:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Data stack, used for expression evaluation.
@item
Loop stack, used for local variables, return addresses and so forth.
@end itemize

The data stack is directly visible to the @sc{muf} programmer,
and holds a simple unstructured sequences of values.

The loop stack has a more intricate structure consisting essentially
of typed records of various lengths.  For a full discussion of
loop stacks, see @ref{Loop Stacks,,,muqimp.t,Loop Stacks}.

The functions in this section provide ways to inspect and
modify the other-wise inaccessable loop stack contents.
They are intended primarily for use in debuggers.

If @code{@@$s.actingUser} doesn't ``control'' the stackframe
in question, the @code{getStackframe[} return block
contains only

@example
[ :owner o |
@end example

@noindent
where @code{o} is the ``owner'' of the stackframe;
otherwise it returns a full dump of the contents of the

The ``owner'' of a stackframe is the value of
@code{@@$s.actingUser} at the time the stackframe
was created.  A job ``controls'' a stackframe iff
@code{@@$s.actingUser} for the job is the owner
of the stackframe, or else is root running with
the @sc{omnipotent} bit set.

Muq takes @sc{ansi} Common Lisp as the ultimate standard for
the semantics of all functions in this section; The current
implementation does not claim to be fully compliant, but
programs should not be written to depend on any differences
between the standard and the current implementation.

For simplicity and portability, the current implementation
merely uses the math functions provided by the host C
libraries.

The @code{exptmod} function takes three integer operands @code{b},
@code{p}, @code{m} and computes @code{b} to the @code{p} power mod
@code{m} -- an operation frequently used by various digital signature
schemes and related public-key based authentication techniques.

The @code{exptmod} function is implemented using Montgomery exponentiation, meaning
that results up to about 512 bits can be computed in seconds.  (I've
computed results up to about 9,000 bit this way, but that takes half
an hour or more, and requires recompiling bnm.t with some constants
set larger.)

Message streams are Muq's answer to unix pipes: They are
bounded buffers serving as communication channels and
synchronization mechanisms between jobs.

Unlike unix streams, Muq message streams may contain values of
any sort whatever, including jobs and message streams,
although string is still the usual fare.

This is the fundamental non-root function for reading a

anti-spoofing measure.
(@pxref{|writeStreamPacket}.)

One normally supplies @code{t} for @code{noFragments}, meaning
that only completed packets should be read:  Supplying
@code{nil} for this parameter will result in even
incomplete packets being returned, which is
occasionally useful.

If no input is available, the job blocks until something
arrives, unless both @code{stream$s.dead}

in which case an empty block plus two @code{nil}s are returned.

@display
@exdent file: job.t
@exdent package: muf
@exdent status: alpha
@end display

This is Muq's closest analogue to the C/Unix select() call:
It waits until input is available on one of the given
streams and returns a block from that stream.

The @code{[streams]} argument must be a block of
streams.  There may currently be at most thirteen
streams in the block.

The @code{nf} argument is same as the @code{noFragments}
@code{readStreamPacket[} argument.

The @code{millisecs} argument must be either @code{nil} or a
positive (not zero!) integer limit on the number of
milliseconds which the job should wait for input to arrive.
If this limit is exceeded, the job will return
@code{[ | nil nil nil}.  (Zero @code{millisecs} values are
disallowed in order to discourage waste of CPU
resources in busy-wait loops.)

The @code{[values]} @code{tag} and @code{who} return
values are as in @code{readStreamPacket[}.

The @code{s} return value is the particular stream
from which the packet was read, or @code{nil} if the call
timed out before input arrived.  (The logically
separate operations of finding a nonempty stream and
reading from it are combined into a single operation in
order to avoid race events -- if they were
separate, some other job might empty the stream between
the two operations.)

Example.  Here is a simple implementation of
@code{sleepJob} based on
@code{|readAnyStreamPacket}:

@example
:   my-sleep-job @{ $ -> @} -> millisecs
    [ | t millisecs
    |readAnyStreamPacket
    pop pop pop ]pop
;
@end example

Example.  Here is a loop that merges two input streams
into one output stream:

@example
:   merge-streams @{ $ $ $ -> @@ @} -> outstream -> instream2 -> instream1
    do@{
        ( Read a block from either input stream: )

The 'who' value should normally be the value of
@code{@@$s.actingUser} in the job sending the

case of message streams fed from the net, there
is no such @code{@@$s.actingUser} value in
general (since any process anywhere on the
Internet might have sent the value) so the

This is a fundamental function for writing to a stream.
A block of arbitrary values with an arbitrary
tag is written into the @code{stream}.

The @code{done} argument should normally be @code{t},
but may be used to build up a packet using a sequence
of @code{|writeStreamPacket} calls, by setting
@code{done} to @code{nil} on all but the final call
in a sequence.

(Any write to the same stream by another job in the
middle of this sequence will result in premature
completion of the packet, which will emerge from the
stream as two or more packets, with the interrupting
foriegn packets interspersed.)

To facilitate writing the same packet to many streams, the
arguments (other than the stream) are not popped.

If necessary, the job will block until space becomes available.

return value indicating success/failure is provided.)

This function is provided as one way of allowing
messages to be sent to a group of listeners without
risking having the sending job block indefinitely due
to one blocked listener.

If @code{stream} is a proxy and @code{muqnet:maybeWriteStreamPacket}
names a function, that function will be invoked:  This is part of the
inserver support for transparent networking.

In addition, if @code{stream} is a @sc{mos} object
and @code{muf:maybeWriteStreamPacket} names a function, that
function will be invoked: This is additional inserver support for
transparent networking.  The standard
@code{muf:maybeWriteStreamPacket} function redirects the write to
@code{stream.io} if it exists and is a message stream, else issues an
error: This little hack allows requests to be written directly to a
@sc{mos} object rather than to its @code{io} messageStream, saving the caller
the choice between using an extra network roundTrip to fetch the
recipient's @code{io} property, or passing it around in company with the

This function is intended to be used internally by

It has been suggested that the Muq server supports
everything but the kitchen sink.  This is untrue: Muq has
had a fully functional, @sc{posix}-compliant kitchenSinks
function since version -2.4, 94Mar26.

This function accepts no arguments, and returns the number
of kitchen sinks physically installed on the host system.

If this number is nonzero for your system, add (say)

@example
#define MUQ_KITCHEN_SINKS 2
@end example

to your h/Site-config.h before compiling Muq.

Note: If the number of kitchen sinks on your
system tends to fluctuate erratically, you may
wish to put

@example
setenv KITCHEN_SINKS `ls -lR /dev                 \
                    | egrep -i "kitchen.*sink.*"  \
                    | wc -l`
@end example

@noindent
in your .login script, and then add

@example
-DMUQ_KITCHEN_SINKS=$@{KITCHEN_SINKS@}
@end example

@noindent
to CDEBUGFLAGS and COPTFLAGS in c/Makefile2.in and
c/Makefile2.  On most systems, this will automatically
give you the correct value each time you recompile.

If your unix has non-standard kitchen-sink

Note that no quotas are applied to the logfile, hence (for

for completeness.

Class Plain, like the other built-in classes, can be used
to store key-val pairs much as can Index:  The trade-off
is that Plain objects do not have four slots pre-allocated
to hold the btrees, but finding the associated btrees (if
any) requires an additional btree lookup to find the btree
itself.  Thus, if you need to create many objects which can
be used to store key-val pairs, but very few of which actually
do so, you might conceivably wish to use Plain rather than
Index objects to save a little space.

Port numbers are integers in the range
1-65535 used to distinguish between different
services offered by a given machine on the
internet.  Each internet machine has one space
of 65535 port numbers for @sc{tcp} connections
and a second, separate space of 65535 port
numbers for @sc{udp} connections.

These port numbers form the only way of distinguishing
between different processes or users on the same
machine using the @sc{udp} and @sc{tcp} Internet
protocols:  An internet IP address (128.95.44.22, say)
plus a port number form the most specific Internet
address these protocols understand.

Every process communicating over the Internet via these
protocols must have at least one port number assigned
to it.  A process which is communicating simultaneously
with many other processes may have dozens or even
hundreds of port numbers assigned to it.

Some port numbers have only temporary significance,
being assigned for the duration of a program run.  Port
numbers assigned to a telnet or rlogin session are in
this category.  These numbers are called "ephemeral"
and are usually picked arbitrarily by the operating
system from the set of currently free port numbers.

Other port numbers have specific, widely understood
meanings, which processes on other machines use to
locate specific services.  For example, 'sendmail'
always runs on @sc{tcp} port 25, and other systems
count on this when sending mail.  These numbers
are called 'well-known' numbers, and the best
established ones are published periodically:
see 
@strong{http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1700.txt}
(mirrored at
@strong{http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/docs/rfc/rfc1700.txt}).

Certain ranges of port numbers have special
significance.

In particular, ports 1-1023 (in both the @sc{tcp} and
@sc{udp} address spaces) are reserved for processes
running with unix root privilege.  This provides a
certain (weak) amount of authentication: If you connect
to a port in this range, you can have some confidence
that the process you contact was set up by the
authority controlling that machine, rather that by some
arbitrary user.

Unix typically (but not always @footnote{W R
Stevens in @emph{Unix Network Programming p304}
notes that "The system doesn't automatically
assign a port greater than 5000.  It leaves these
ports for user-developed, nonpriveleged servers."
Solaris appears to automatically assign all ports,
alas.}) allocates ephemeral @sc{tcp} ports from
the range 1024-5000, and ephemeral @sc{udp} ports
from the range 1024-32767.  If your are picking a
well-known port for a new service, you might want
to avoid these ranges, in order to avoid finding
yourself unable to restart your server due to
(say) some telnet session having been assigned
your port number.

In addition, it is best to avoid ports used by other
well-known services, both to avoid confusion, and to
avoid conflict should you wish to run one of those
services on your machine at some point.  For example,
the X Window System uses @sc{tcp} ports 6000-6063,
which makes this an excellent port range to avoid.

Note that @sc{tcp} ports in the range 10,000 -> 65,535
are almost entirely unused at present -- you don't
@emph{have} to try and squeeze into the crowded
5000-9999 range.

A reasonable choice for a new @sc{tcp} port number for
an in-db Muq daemon supporting local, experimental, or
game functionality would be '2' followed by the last
four digits of your phone number.  This scatters them
randomly, minimizing the chance of port-choice
collisions, without depending on a central registration
authority.

For production in-db Muq daemons which parallel the
function of an existing unix daemon at port xyz, I
suggest using port 30xyz: Port 30007 for echo, 30011
for systat listing of users, 30079 for finger, 30023
for telnet, 30025 for mail, 30080 for HTTP, &tc.

For production in-db Muq daemons not corresponding to
an existing unix daemon, I suggest using ports
31000-31999, ideally registering them with some central
coordinator.

For random test scripts connecting only to the local
machine but needing a specific port, I suggest using
ports 32000-32767.

When multiple Muq servers must export a full complement
of daemons from the same @sc{ip} address, I suggest the
second use the range 32000-33999 in place of
30000-31999, the third use the range 34000-35999, and
so forth.

is @code{@@$s.standardInput} (the input message stream
for the job issuing the @code{]listenOnSocket}

If @code{:protocol} is @code{:stream} (or omitted),
each connection accepted will result in
the creation of a Socket bound to the connection, which
will be placed in the messageStream @code{socket$S.standardOutput}.  The
presumption is that some job is reading this
message stream and forking off a job for each
connection accepted.

If @code{:protocol} is @code{:datagram},
@code{socket$S.type} will be set to @code{:udp}
and the socket will return datagrams read from
that port.

The @code{:addressFamily} parameter must currently always

Here is a complete short example of listening on
a socket.  Normally the work done in the example
would involve three jobs, one for the listening
socket, one for the server (forked by the listening
job) and one for the client, probably on another
machine.  Here we do everything inline in one job
to keep things simple;  See the nanomud for a
more realistic example.

The @code{:socket} parameter must be a socket ; It
should be either freshly created
@xref{makeSocket}, or else one which has been
closed by @xref{]closeSocket}.  Before making this
call, you should set the socket's
@code{$s.standardInput} and @code{$s.standardOutput}
keys to the message streams which you wish the socket
connection to use.

The @code{:addressFamily} parameter may be omitted, and
must currently always be @code{:internet} if present; It is
provided for future expansion of functionality.

The @code{:protocol} parameter may be omitted, in which
case it defaults to @code{:stream}, indicating a @sc{tcp}
connection.  If @code{:datagram} is specified, an @sc{udp}
socket is opened.

When writing to @sc{udp} sockets, you can (and usually
should) specify the destination address and port
on a datagram-by-datagram basis using
@code{|writeStreamPacket} and the keywords
@code{:ip0}, @code{:ip1}, @code{:ip2}, @code{:ip3}
and @code{:port}.  For example, to send "This is a test"
to port 9 at 128.95.44.22 you might do:

@example
[ :ip0 128 :ip1 95 :ip2 44 :ip3 22 :port 9
  'T' 'h' 'i' 's' ' ' 'i' 's' ' ' 'a' ' ' 't' 'e' 's' 't'
| "txt" t my-udp-stream |writeStreamPacket pop pop ]pop
@end example

The keyval pairs may be anywhere in the block, although
grouping them at the beginning or end is recommended.
If the address or port is not specified this way, the
values from the previous datagram are used, or failing
that, those specified in the @code{]openSocket}.

In the current Muq implementation, you cannot count on
being able to send datagrams of more than 2000 bytes
if @code{"\n" -> "\r\n"} conversion is enabled, or of more
than 4000 bytes if this conversion is disabled
(@code{socket$S.nlToCrnlOnOutput} property);
similar size contraints apply to datagram reception.
Oversize datagrams are likely to be silently dropped.
Let me know if these limitations become a problem.

Note that sending datagrams larger than the path
MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) is inefficient and
normally avoided by good networking code.  Typical
wide-area network MTU values range from 500 to 1500
bytes.

"As an experiment, this ... was run numerous times to
various hosts around the world.  Fifteen countries
(including Antarctica) were reached and various
transatlantic and transpacific links were used. ...
Out of 18 runs, only 2 had a path MTU of less than
1500." -- W R Stevens, @emph{@sc{TCP/IP} Illustrated
Vol I 1994}.
@end quotation

You should usually set @code{socket$s.inputByLines}
to @code{nil} on a @sc{udp} socket, since you will want
to read complete datagrams one at a time, rather than
single lines from them.

@quotation
@cartouche
Remember that the Internet @sc{udp} datagram service
is @strong{unreliable}!  Datagrams can and frequently
do get lost without any notification to client or
server.  Any code which uses @sc{udp} datagrams must
be prepared to deal with this.
@end cartouche
@end quotation

The @code{:host} parameter gives the destination host
to contact, and should be a string containing
either a dotted-decimal Internet address such as
"128.95.44.22" or else a symbolic Internet address such as
"sl.tcp.com".  Alternatively, the @code{:ip0}, @code{:ip1},
@code{:ip2} and @code{:ip3} parameters may be used to
specify the destination host address using four integers.
Providing both forms of address is an error;  If neither
is provided, the default localhost address of 127.0.0.1
will be used.

The @code{:port} parameter must be an integer specifying the
unix port to which to connect.  If no port is specified,
the default telnet port 23 will be used.

@strong{Example.}  Here's a function which prints one line from
the given port on the host machine:

@example
:   print-port @{ $ -> @} -> port

    ( Create a socket for network I/O: )
    makeSocket -> socket

    ( Hook up input and output streams to it: )
    makeMessageStream -> in
    makeMessageStream -> out
    in  --> socket$s.standardInput
    out --> socket$s.standardOutput

    ( Open a connection to given port: )
    [ :socket socket :port port | ]openSocket

    ( Read and print one line from socket: )
    out readStreamLine pop ,

    ( Close the socket: )
    [ :socket socket | ]closeSocket
;
@end example

Here is an example of @code{print-port} in action.
Port 13 ("daytime") supplies the current date and time.
Port 19 ("chargen") generates an endless stream
of text.

@example
stack:
13 print-port
Thu Oct 19 00:28:06 1995

19 print-port

@strong{Example.}  Here's code to communicate via
a pair of @sc{udp} ports.  Remember that @sc{udp}
is an unreliable protocol, so any packet transmitted
may be silently lost.  Normally the client and

of course!

The @code{]rootPopenSocket} spawns a host process
connected to the Muq server via pipes.  The
@code{@@$S.actingUser} must be @code{root} to do
this.)

The @code{:socket} parameter must be a socket; It
should be either freshly created
@xref{makeSocket}, or else one which has been
closed by @xref{]closeSocket}.  Before making this
call, you should set the socket's
@code{$s.standardInput} and @code{$s.standardOutput}
keys to the message streams which you wish the socket
connection to use.

The @code{:commandline} parameter may take one
of three forms:

@table @strong
@item :commandline "| srv args"
Subprocess reads from socket, output to @code{/dev/null}.
@item :commandline   "srv args |"
Subprocess reads from @code{/dev/null}, output to socket.
@item :commandline "| srv args |"
Subprocess both reads and writes from socket.
@end table

Note that in the third case, it is often necessary that
the subprocess disable output buffering in order to
avoid a deadlock in which it blocks waiting for input
while its output sits unsent in its stdio output
buffer.  Subprocesses written in Perl may disable
output buffering by doing

@example
select( (select(STDOUT), $| = 1)[0]);
@end example

@noindent
while subprocesses written in C may disable output
buffering by doing

@example
setvbuf( stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0 );
@end example

@noindent
or simply by using raw @code{write()} calls in
place of the stdio @code{printf}, @code{fprintf}
@dots{} family of buffered output calls.

In all events, Muq will look for the server in the host
directory given by db property @code{.muq$S.srvdir},
which is usually @code{muq/srv} but may be set to other
values by editing the value of @code{srvdir} in
@code{muq/bin/Muq-config.sh} or by using the
@code{--srvdir=/var/people/pat/muq/srv} commandline
switch when invoking Muq.

Security precautions include:
@itemize @bullet

@item
There is no way to modify the @code{.muq$S.srvdir} property
from within a running server.

@item
Server names specified may not begin with a period,
and must consist only of letters, digits, periods
and dashes. (In particular, slashes are not allowed.)

@item
This facility may be disabled completely by
specifying @code{--srvdir} (no server directory)
on the commandline.

@item
Servers are started up by a direct @code{fork()} and
@code{exec()}, without the security problems of an
intervening shell.  (Hence also without most of the
conveniences of an intervening shell, such as wildcard
or environment variable expansion.)

@strong{Gory Details}
@itemize @bullet

@item
Subprocess streams which you do not specify are
set to @code{/dev/null}.  In particular, @code{stdout}

@item
Doing @code{[ :socket s | ]closeSocket} on a socket
opened with @code{]rootPopenSocket} will return immediately,
but the socket will not be ready for re-use until the
subprocess actually exits (as determined by recieving
a @sc{sigchld} signal and querying @code{waitpid()}).
When you call @code{]closeSocket} Muq sends a @sc{hup},
and if that doesn't do the trick within
@code{skt_milliseconds_of_grace} (normally 30000) milliseconds,
sends a @sc{sigkill}.  If @emph{that} has no effect
within another @code{skt_milliseconds_of_grace} milliseconds,
is closes the pipes and frees the socket anyhow.

You may examine @code{socket$S.closedBy} to determine
what terminated a subprocess:  It will be @code{:exit}
if the subprocess called @code{exit()} (in which case
@code{socket$S.exitStatus} will have the integer
exit status), @code{:close} if the subprocess was killed
by a Muq @code{]closeSocket}, and @code{:signal} if
it was killed by any other signal (in which case
@code{socket$S.lastSignal} will have the integer

@subsubsection "write-only-1|"

Here is a simple example of running a
Muq subserver which writes a stream
of text output to the current standard
output.  It assumes you have Perl
installed on your system.

In @code{muq/srv/} create a file @code{write-only-1} with
contents

@example
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
select( (select(STDOUT), $| = 1)[0]);
for (;;) @{
    printf "Loop %d\n", $loop++;
    sleep 10;
@}
@end example

At the unix level, do @code{chmod +x write-only-1}
to make the script executable.

Now, at the Muq prompt do:

@example
root:
makeSocket --> s    @@$s.standardOutput --> s$s.standardOutput
root:
[ :socket s :commandline "write-only-1|" | ]rootPopenSocket
root:
@end example

You will see a sequence of lines

@example
Loop 0
Loop 1
...
@end example

printing out, one every ten seconds.  These
are being copied directly from the socket
into the output stream for the current job,
so they will not interfere with anything
else you might wish to do.

You may close down the subprocess by doing

@example
root:
[ :socket s | ]closeSocket
root:
@end example

@c
@node   write-only-2|, |read-only-1, write-only-1|,  ]rootPopenSocket
@subsubsection "write-only-2|"

This is a simple variant on
@code{write-only-1|}: Instead of routing
coprocess output directly to the output
stream of the current job, we route it
to the input stream, so that it gets
processed by the current interpreter.

In @code{muq/srv/} create a file @code{write-only-2} with
contents

@example
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
select( (select(STDOUT), $| = 1)[0]);
for (;;) @{
    printf "\"Loop %d\\n\" ,\n", $loop++;
    sleep 10;
@}
@end example

As before, at the unix level, do
@code{chmod +x write-only-2} to make
the script executable.

Now, at the Muq prompt do:

@example
root:
makeSocket --> s    @@$s.standardInput$s.twin --> s$s.standardOutput
root:
[ :socket s :commandline "write-only-2|" | ]rootPopenSocket
root:
@end example

You will see a sequence of lines

@example
Loop 0
root:
Loop 1
root:
...
@end example

printing out, one every ten seconds, but
this time they result from the execution
by the @sc{muf} interpreter of a series
of lines

@example
"Loop 0\n" ,
"Loop 1\n" ,
...
@end example

read from the coprocess.  (Since the @sc{muf}
interpreter prints a new prompt after each
command executed, this time you see a prompt
printed after each "Loop" line.)

As before, you may close down the subprocess by doing

@example
root:
[ :socket s | ]closeSocket
root:
@end example

@strong{Gory Detail:}

In the example, we use
@code{@@$s.standardInput$s.twin} rather that just
@code{@@$s.standardInput} because in general
@code{@@$s.standardInput} and
@code{@@$s.standardOutput} may be equal, both pointing
to the same bidirectional stream.  (This is virtually
required by the CommonLisp standard in the simple case,
since @code{@@$S.terminalIo} must be bidirectional,
and must be used by @code{@@$s.standardInput} and
@code{@@$s.standardOutput}.)

Because Muq implements bidirectional streams using two
unidirectional streams, and always indirecting all
reads through @code{stream$s.twin} (which points to the
stream itself in unidirectional streams),
@code{@@$s.standardInput$s.twin} gives us the stream
which, when written, is guaranteed to deliver input
to the current job.

If this is confusing, just remember that writing to
@code{@@$s.standardInput$s.twin} will always send
input to the current job, whether it is using
bidirection or unidirectional message streams.

@cindex syslogd
@cindex MIDI
@cindex email generation
@subsubsection "read-only-1|"

The last two examples were readOnly servers: Muq
was reading from them but not writing to them.
Here we provide simple example of a write-only
server.  Write-only servers might be useful in
practice for controlling an output device (such as
driving an output MIDI music port, say) or perhaps
for generating email, say as part of a
registration system.

To keep this example simple, our example server
will merely accept text, convert it to upper case,
and print it on the console.  (A simple variant
might be used to provide access to the syslogd
daemon from within the Muq.)

In @code{muq/srv/} create a file @code{read-only-1} with
contents

@example
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
open(STDOUT,">/dev/tty");
select( (select(STDOUT), $| = 1)[0]);
print "read-only-1 STARTING\n";
while (<STDIN>) @{
    tr/a-z/A-Z/;
    print;
@}
print "read-only-1 DONE\n";
exit(0);
@end example

Again, at the unix level, do
@code{chmod +x read-only-1} to make
the script executable.

(Remember that in this example we are sending the
output to the unix @code{/dev/tty} device, hence
it will work as shown only when running Muq from
the unix commandline, not when telnetted into
Muq.)

Now, at the Muq prompt do:

@example
root:
makeSocket --> s
root:
makeMessageStream --> m
root:
m --> s$S.standardInput
root:
[ :socket s :commandline "|read-only-1" | ]rootPopenSocket
root:
read-only-1 STARTING
@end example

We now have the message stream @code{m}
leading to our readOnly job @code{read-only-1}
via the socket @code{s}, and thus may
feed test line-by-line to @code{read-only-1}
by stuffing it into @code{m}:

@example
"testing 1...\n" m writeStream
root: 
TESTING 1...
"testing 2...\n" m writeStream
root:
TESTING 2...
@end example

As usual, you may close down the subprocess by doing

@example
[ :socket s | ]closeSocket
read-only-1 DONE
root:
@end example


@c
@node   |unix-string-upcase-1|, |unix-string-upcase-2|, |read-only-1,  ]rootPopenSocket
@subsubsection "|unix-string-upcase-1|"

The last three examples involved communication
only one direction with the subprocess: Either
readOnly or write-only.  This arrangement
is simple and reliable, and is good when it
suffices, but we often need to send information
both to and from the subprocess.

Arranging such two-way communication with a
Muq subprocess is simple, but when doing so
you must always be wary of falling into a
@emph{deadlock} configuration in which both
ends of the socket are waiting for the other
to send something.

One good way to avoid deadlock is to use
separate Muq jobs to read and write the
socket.  If you are sending long blocks of
information each direction, this approach
is recommended.

Another way to avoid deadlock is to simply
send short one-line queries and responses,
and to always wait for the response to one
query before sending the next.  We will
use this approach in this example.

In this example, we show how to use a unix
coprocess as a subroutine: We will define a
process which reads one line, converts it to upper
case, returns the result, and then exits.  We will
then write a @sc{muf} function which hides the
process of invoking the server, so that we wind up
with a function which to the caller looks much
like @code{stringUpcase} -- but much slower,
since a unix process must be started and stopped
for each call.  This is not a practical way to
convert strings to uppercase, of course!  But this
might be a practical way to invoke a special
@sc{ftp} subserver, say, which fetched files on
command from another site and then perhaps loaded
them into the Muq db.

For simplicity, our example function will also
assume that the given string contains exactly
one newline, at the end of the string, and hence
can be trivially read and written as a single line.

In @code{muq/srv/} create a file @code{unix-string-upcase-1} with
contents

@example
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
$_ = <STDIN>;
tr/a-z/A-Z/;
print;
exit(0);
@end example

As usual, at the unix level, do
@code{chmod +x unix-string-upcase-1} to make
the script executable.

Now, at the Muq prompt do:

@example
root:
: my-string-upcase-1 @{ $ -> $ @} -> input
;----> makeSocket -> s
;----> makeMessageStream -> i
;----> makeMessageStream -> o
;----> i --> s$S.standardInput
;----> o --> s$S.standardOutput
;----> [ :socket s :commandline "|unix-string-upcase-1|" | ]rootPopenSocket
;----> input i writeStream
;----> o readStreamLine pop
;----> ;
root:
"abc\n" my-string-upcase-1
root: "ABC
"
@end example

@strong{Fine point:} Our @code{my-string-upcase-1}
function doesn't bother explicitly closing the
socket.  Doing an explicit close would do no
harm, but since our @code{unix-string-upcase-1} program exits
by itself, and since Muq will close the socket
automatically when the associated process exits,
there is no actual need to explicitly close the
socket.




@c
@node   |unix-string-upcase-2|, predicates, |unix-string-upcase-1|,  ]rootPopenSocket
@subsubsection "|unix-string-upcase-2|"

The previous example showed bidirectional
communication, but starts up a new unix process
for each request.  This can be a reasonable
approach, but often we wish to have a subserver
handle multiple requests before exiting.  This
might be because we wish to avoid the overhead of
starting up a unix process for each request (at
the price of maintaining an open socket), or it
might be because we wish to have the server
preserve state between calls (we might be using
GeomView as a subserver to do 3D graphics display,
for example) or it might be because we want to
make sure only one copy of the subserver in
question is running, either to limit system
resources used by the Muq server or to prevent
attempts to share an unsharable resource such as a
single-user database.

In this example, we show how to set up and access
such a server.  To keep the example simple, we
again have our subserver do nothing more than
convert given text to uppercase, but it is
still significantly more complex than
previous examples.

In @code{muq/srv/} create a file @code{unix-string-upcase-2} with
contents

@example
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
select( (select(STDOUT), $| = 1)[0]);
while (<STDIN>) @{
    tr/a-z/A-Z/;
    print;
@}
exit(0);
@end example

At the unix level, do the usual
@code{chmod +x unix-string-upcase-2} to make
the script executable.

Now, define the following function in Muq:

@example
nil --> *my-socket*
:   my-string-upcase-2 @{ $ -> $ @} -> input

    ( Run as root so normal users )
    ( can invoke the subserver:   )

@cindex Predicates

Predicates accept some argument(s), and return a
true-or-false value.  Muq muf follows the Scheme (and Muck
@sc{muf}) tradition of ending predicates with a question
mark, rather than the CommonLisp tradition of ending them
with a "-p".  This is much more readable, and such
superficial syntax differences should pose few compatibility
problems with Muq CommonLisp code@footnote{CommonLisp avoids
this notation for the excellent reason that it wishes to
reserve the '?' character to users for Lisp reader macros.
Muq @sc{muf} not having reader macros, the reason does not
apply, and in any event, the Muq @sc{muf} design emphasizes
convenience for novices more highly than maximum power for
professionals.}.

This function is hand-assembled into the db by cdt.t
because @code{.lib.muf.]doSignal} needs it,

functioning as soon as the server starts

@subsection regular expression syntax
@cindex Regular expression syntax

This node is not a tutorial, just a quick synopsis of
syntax.

Current Muq @sc{muf} regular expression syntax is implemented primarily
in @code{muq/pkg/175-C-rex.t} -- which is incidentally a good example of
a compiler for an embedded language in @sc{muf} -- with some C-coded
support in @code{muq/c/rex.t}.

Muq @sc{muf} follows the lead of Larry Wall's @sc{Perl} language in
regular expression syntax: His syntax has a simple quoting rule and
minimizes the number of backslashes needed in typical uses of regular
expressions.  (I wince every time I read a regular expression written in
emacs lisp.)  The current implementation follows Perl v4: One of these
days we'll probably add support for the v5 extensions.

Here are the regular expression operators Muq @sc{muf}
currently recognizes:
@example
a       Match given char.  Ditto other chars not listed below.
.       Match any single character except a newline.
[a-z]   Match any single character in the given ascii range. 
[^a-z]  Match any single character @emph{not} in the given ascii range. 

\d      Match any single decimal digit: Same as [0-9].
\D      Inverse of above:  Same as [^0-9].

\s      Match any single whitespace char.
\S      Inverse of above.

\w      Match any single word-component char:  Same as [a-zA-Z0-9_].
\W      Inverse of above:  Same as [^a-zA-Z0-9_].

^ $     Match beginning or end of given string, respectively.

\n \r \t \f \0 Match newline/carraige-return/tab/formfeed/nul (respectively)

(<rex>) Parens group interior <rex> into a unit for exterior operators;
        Parens also remember the substring they matched.

<rex>*  Matches <rex> zero or more times.

<rex>+  Matches <rex> one or more times.

<rex>?  Matches <rex> zero or one times.

<rex>@{n@} Matches <rex> exactly n times.

<rex>@{n,@} Matches <rex> at least n times.

<rex>@{n,m@} Matches <rex> at least n and at most m times.

<rex0>|<rex1>   Match exactly one of <rex0> or <rex1>.
@end example

Hints:

@example
To include ^ in a character set, make it non-first: [a-z^].
To include - in a character set, make it first: [-az]
To subdue all operators, precede all nonalphanumeric chars with "\".
In particular, to include a literal backslash, insert "\\".
@end example

@c
@node  rex, rexBegin, regular expression syntax, regular expressions
@subsection rex

The @code{rex:} operator defines a function expressed in the
previously described regular expression syntax.  The regular
expression proper is preceded and followed by an arbitrary
delimiter character, which may be any printing character
desired.

The resulting function accepts a single string as input and returns at
minimum a boolean flag indicating whether or not the string was
successfully matched.

@example
Stack:
rex: myfn /^ab*c$/
Stack:
"abc" myfn
Stack: t
pop "ad" myfn
Stack: nil
@end example

If there are any parentheses in the regular expression, the function in
addition returns one string value for each parenthesis pair, giving the
substring matched by that parenpair.

@example
Stack:
rex: myfn /^a(b*)c$/
Stack:
"abbbc" myfn
Stack: t "bbb"
pop pop "ad" myfn
Stack: nil ""

The dataStack functions tend to get over-used in muck muf and
traditional forth due to the lack of dynamic variables, with
consequent losses to code readability.

When using these, please be sure your code could not
be better expressed using local variables (which are
just as fast, and usually more readable).

When using stack and stream objects, note that generic object
functions are also applicable:  For example, @code{vals[} may
be used to extract the contents of a stack object in a block.

The @code{countLinesInString} function is a trivial

This function is identical to @code{secureHash} except that the

@sc{caveat programmer}: Since the normal @code{secureHash} return value

62 bits, this is much less secure: Use in authentication is not
recommended.

However, if you just want a quick and easy way of reducing a string to
an efficient integer form, @code{secureHashFixnum} may be just the
ticket.

The specific application I had in mind when introducing this was
procedurally defined worlds in which a room is defined by a canonical
path string for it looking something like (say)
@code{"north;west;north;up@dots{}"} -- a fixnum hash of this canonical
name may then be an excellent basis from which to generate name and

@exdent file: job.t
@exdent package: muf
@exdent status: alpha
@end display

This function is intended to allow very simple reformatting
of a paragraph for viewing on a terminal of specified width
in characters.

The @code{delim} parameter is an end-of-line delimiter.
It will usually be "\n", but may (for instance) be set
to "\n  " to produce indented text, or perhaps might
include padding nuls.  The @code{wrapString} function
treats @code{delim} as being of zero length for line-length
computation, so you should reduce @code{width}
accordingly if you are using @code{delim} to implement
indentation.

The @code{width} parameter is a terminal width.  Setting it
to 80 will use the full width of the terminal.  However,
many people suggest using line widths of no more than 72
in order to enhance readability.

The @code{in-string} parameter is the string to be wrapped,
which is presumed to consist of running printable text --
words delimited by whitespace.

The @code{wrapString} function converts all existing
newlines to blanks, then replaces whitespace sequences by
@code{delim} where-ever needed in order to ensure that no
line is more than @code{width} characters long.  If any
word is more than @code{width} characters long, it is
chopped into fragments @code{width} characters long, with
no attempt at hyphenation or finding intelligent points
at which to break the word.

@example
Stack:
"Now is the time for all good furries to come ..."
Stack: "Now is the time for all good furries to come ..."
15 "\n        " wrapString
Stack: "Now is the time

Muq structures are taken from CommonLisp, and are
similar to "structs" in C or "records" in Pascal:
They provide a perspicuous and efficient way of
allocating a chunk of storage organized as a set
of named slots.

@display
@exdent file: job.t

As the name suggests, @code{]defstruct} defines a
structure.  A typical sample use is:

@example
Stack:
[ 'ship   'x 'y 'mass | ]defstruct
@end example

@noindent
which accomplishes the following:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Declares a @code{ship} structure type with three components,
@code{x}, @code{y} and @code{mass}.
@item
The symbol @code{ship} becomes the name of this structure type.
@item
Constructs a function @code{ship?} which is true of (only)
instances of this structure type.
@item
Constructs a function @code{]make-ship} which constructs
instances of this type: @code{[ :x 0.5 :y 2.0 :mass 15.0 | ]make-ship --> s}
@end itemize

The full syntax follows the CommonLisp standard fairly
closely, and (hence?) is fairly intimidating.  Using
the notation @strong{(* x | y *)} to indicate a
sequence of zero or more @strong{x} and/or @strong{y}
instances:

@example
'somestructname (*
  :concName      string |
  :constructor    symbol |
  :copier         symbol |
  :assertion      symbol |
  :predicate      symbol |
  :include        symbol |
  :printFunction cfn    |
  :type           symbol |
  :named          symbol |
  :initialOffset symbol |
  :export         t      *)
(* 'someslotname (*
    :init any                  |

    :classMayRead   tOrNil |
    :classMayWrite  tOrNil |
    :worldMayRead   tOrNil |
    :worldMayWrite  tOrNil |
*) *)
@end example

The first group of options apply to the structure
proper; The last group of options apply to a particular
slot.

Structure options:

@table @code
@item :concName      string
By default, if a structure named @code{ship}
has slots named @code{mast} and @code{sail},
@code{]defstruct} will generate slot-reading
functions called @code{ship-mast} and
@code{ship-sail}, and slot-writing functions
called @code{set-ship-mast} and @code{set-ship-sail}.
Specifying @code{:concName "boat-"} will result
in slot-reading functions called @code{boat-mast}
and @code{boat-sail} and slot-writing functions
called @code{set-boat-mast} and @code{set-boat-sail}.

@item :constructor    symbol
By default, a structure named @code{ship} will

@item :include        symbol
By default, a structure contains only the slots
explicitly named.  Specifying @code{:include

some previously defined structure type will result in
all the slots of @code{somestruct} being included in
the new structure, plus the predicate and slot
functions for the old structure working on the
corresponding slots of the new structure.  This is a
simple but useful form of single inheritence.

Common Lisp defines possibly the most sophisticated

date.  This flexibility comes at the price of myriad
functions defined to control various aspects of MOS.

@c
@node  ]defclass, subclassOf?, MOS overview, MOS functions
@subsection ]defclass
@defun ]defclass @{ [args] -> @}
@display
@exdent file: job.t
@exdent package: muf
@exdent status: alpha
@end display

As the name suggests, @code{]defclass} defines a
class.  A typical sample use is:

@example
Stack:
[ 'ship   'x 'y 'mass | ]defclass
@end example

@noindent
which accomplishes the following:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Declares a @code{ship} structure type with three components,
@code{x}, @code{y} and @code{mass}.
@item
The symbol @code{ship} becomes the name of this structure type.
@item
Constructs a function @code{ship?} which is true of (only)
instances of this structure type.
@item
Constructs a function @code{]make-ship} which constructs
instances of this type: @code{[ :x 0.5 :y 2.0 :mass 15.0 | ]make-ship --> s}
@end itemize

The full syntax follows the CommonLisp standard fairly
closely, and (hence?) is fairly intimidating.  Using
the notation @strong{(* x | y *)} to indicate a
sequence of zero or more @strong{x} and/or @strong{y}
instances:

@example
'aClassName
(* :isA          'anotherClassName 
|  :is            'anotherClassName 
|  :has           'anotherClassName 
|  :hasA         'anotherClassName 
|  :metaclass     'metaclassName
|  :documentation "some text"
|  :fertile       tOrNil
|  :abstract      tOrNil
|  :export        tOrNil
*)
(* :slot :my-slot

  |   :initval  any
  |   :initform cfn

  |   :worldMayWrite  tOrNil
  |   :prot "rw----"
  *)
*)
@end example

The first group of options apply to the class
proper; The last group of options apply to a particular
slot.

Structure options:

@table @code
@item :metaclass symbol
MOS allows you to extend it by defining and
using new metaclasses.  Muq does not currently
support this.

@item :isA symbol
You need one entry like this for each superclass
of the new class.  Muq current requires that the
superclass have already been defined, although CLOS
only requires that it be defined before an
instance of the new class is created.  (The
synonyms @code{:is}, @code{:has} and @code{:hasA} are also
supported, simply because they sometimes let code
read more naturally.)

@item :documentation string
Human-readable documentation describing the class.

@item :initarg symbol value
A symbol name, and the corresponding initial value
for it.  This allows you to specify an initial
value for a slot which you are not declaring.
(Presumably you are either inheriting it, or
expect a subclass of this class to declare it.)

@end table


The next section declares those slots which are
not inherited, together with optional slot options
declaring individual properties for each slot.

Slot options:

@table @code

@item :initform any
Specifies a default initial value for the slot
in a newly created instance of the class.

@item :initarg 'symbol
Specifies a name by which the slot may be
idenfified in @code{initializeInstance}.
MOS allows multiple @code{:initarg} values
per slot, Muq currently allows only one.

@item :type type
This is specified by the CommonLisp standard
but currently ignored.

@item :documentation "some text"
This allows a human-readable description
string to be associated with the slot.

@item :allocation @{ :class | :instance @}
Normally, a slot is allocated space in each
instance of the class.  Specifying an @code{:allocation}
of @code{:class} results in the slot instead
being allocated in the class itself, containing
a single value shared between all instances.


@item :reader 'symbol
Specifies the name for a generic function which
will read the value of this slot from an instance
of this class.  MOS allows multiple
@code{:reader} options per slot, Muq currently
allows only one.

@item :writer 'symbol
Specifies the name for a generic function which
will set the value of this slot in an instance
of this class.  MOS allows multiple
@code{:writer} options per slot, Muq currently
allows only one.

@item :accessor 'xxx
Same as reader, except that a writer named
@code{setf-xxx} will also be defined.  MOS allows
multiple @code{:accessor} options per slot, Muq
currently allows only one.

@item :rootMayRead    tOrNil
This may be set only by root running
@sc{omnipotent}, and prevents root
from reading the field.  Included
mainly for completeness.

@item :rootMayWrite   tOrNil
This may be set only by root running
@sc{omnipotent}, and prevents root
from writing the field.  May be
useful for protecting important
data, or indicating that it may
be safely cached on remote servers.

@item :userMayRead    tOrNil
Controls whether this slot may
be read by the user who did the
@code{]make-foo} creating the
structure containing the slot.

@item :userMayWrite   tOrNil
Controls whether this slot may
be written by the user who did the
@code{]make-foo} creating the
structure containing the slot.

@item :classMayRead  tOrNil
Controls whether this slot may
be read by the owner of the
class defining the object.

@item :classMayWrite tOrNil
Controls whether this slot may
be written by the owner of the
class defining the object.

@item :worldMayRead   tOrNil
Controls whether this slot may
be read by random unprivileged
users.

@item :worldMayWrite  tOrNil
Controls whether this slot may
be written by random unprivileged
users.

@item :prot "rw----"
An abbreviation for the preceding
six properties:  The six characters
in the value string
control user, class and world
read/write privileges in the
obvious fashion.

The @code{linkMosKeyToAncestor} function links
@code{mosKey} to its @code{slot-num}-th ancestor
(using hidden links in its internal ancestor vector).

The effective user must either control the ancestor
in question or else it's @code{fertile} flag must
be non-@code{nil}.

This provides a way to find all descendants of a
given superclass when it is time to update them to
reflect changes in the superclass.

The @code{unlinkMosKeyFromAncestor} function unlinks

in due course (something which the hidden links would
otherwise prevent).

Low level btree functions used to store key-value

Note:  These functions have currently been dropped from the server due
to technical problems:  It is difficult to ensure that the btree and
the parent object stay in the same dbfile.  There doesn't seem a strong
reason to work on this since you can always use Hash or Index
objects to achieve much the same thing with slightly more overhead.
If you come across a good reason to revive these functions, let me
know and I'll look into it.

Muq stores the properties on @code{myIndex} in a @strong{btree}, a
standard computer data structure capable of handling anything
from a handful of values to millions of values with reasonable
efficiency.

The following functions provide low-level access to the in-server
functions which build and access these btrees.

Most users will never have any reason to use them directly: The standard
high-level interface via objects is sufficient.  Such users have no
reason to read this section: Just use @code{makeHash} to create an
object with key-val pairs stored in a hashed btree (accessible via
@code{obj[key]}) or @code{makeIndex} to create an object with
key-val pairs stored in a sorted btree (again accessible via
@code{obj[key]}).

@xref{makeHash}.
@xref{makeIndex}.

Occasionally, however, it may prove useful to use disembodied btrees
without associated parent objects, or to build similar btree
functionality into other classes of objects:  The following functions
provide the low-level access to the in-server btree functionality
needed in such cases.

@c

@subsection makeHashedBtree
@defun makeHashedBtree @{ -> nullHashedBtree @}
@display
@exdent file: job.t
@exdent package: muf
@exdent status: alpha
@end display

The @code{makeHashedBtree} function constructs and
returns a new @code{nullHashedBtree} instance.  This is
an immediate value (it takes no space beyond the
return slot itself).

All the other btree functions operate equally well on
hashed or sorted btrees.

Hashed btrees can often be faster than sorted btrees, because they do
all interior comparisons on hashes of keys, rather than the keys
themselves: If the keys are long strings, say, comparing integer hash
values can be much faster than comparing the string keys themselves.

On the other hand, hashed btrees require three values per key-val pair
in the leaf, meaning that big trees may take 50% more space, and when
you iterate over them, the keys will appear in an arbitrary order
dictated by the hash function.  If your keys are small immediate values
anyhow anyhow (integers of 62 bits or less, or strings of seven bytes or
less), a hashed tree won't buy you anything, and you might as well use a
sorted tree.

Sorted trees are preferred if you need to be able to iterate over the

such as integers of 62 bits or less.

Hashed trees are preferred if you want efficient lookup on keys
which are expensive to compare, such as long strings.

@node  low-level btree wrapup, symbol functions, copyBtree, low-level btree functions
@subsection low-level btree wrapup

Muq btrees are a fairly stock implementation, except that nonleafl key
comparisons are done on hashes of the key values rather than the key
values directly, which may speed access in some cases, such as perhaps
when the keys are long strings with a common prefix.

Currently, internal nodes contain about 10-20 children, with leaf nodes
containing about 7-15 key-val pairs: Searching is linear within both
kinds of nodes.  (Linear unsorted lists are usually the fastest
algorithm for list lengths less than about 8-16.)

This means that for very small btrees, insertion and deletion
performance is close to that of unsorted lists, typically requiring no
storage allocation or garbage collection, while for very large btrees,
efficiency is close to that usually achieved in databases: A btree with
a million entries will be only three levels deep.

if you know you just freed up a lot of storage.

The return value is a human-readable string summarizing

This function does a monolithic backup of the entire db.
The server stops until backup is
complete.  I'd like to think that this function is a
temporary kludge which will be removed in a future release.

You may find it easier and more reliable to use the
inserver support for periodic backups rather than
the @code{rootDoBckup} function: Just set the

@example
.muq$s.dateOfNextBackup
.muq$s.millisecsBetweenBackups

@noindent
to nonzero values (the default) and the server will do
the rest.

Conversely, if you wish precise control of backup timing,
you may wish to zero the above two properties and call
@code{rootDoBckup} exactly when you want backups done.

Also relevant is the

@example
.muq$s.maxDbCopiesToKeep

@end display

The @code{rootMakeDbfile} function creates and returns a new
instance of Class DatabaseFile.  Since each such instance
is associated with a section of the database stored in
a host file, as a side-effect a host file will be created.

The @code{proposedName} argument may be an integer;  only
the lowest twenty-one bits will be used.  The high bit
distinguishes system library from personal dbfiles.

The @code{proposedName} argument may also be a text
string of four letters.  Lower-case letters are used
for personal dbfiles, uppercase letters are used
for system files.

In either of the above cases, if the @code{proposedName}
is inappropriate (too long, say), it will be modified
appropriately, and if it conflicts with the name of
an existing dbfile, it will be incremented until there
is no conflict.

Finally, the @code{proposedName} argument may be @code{nil},
in which case an unused dbname is assigned randomly.

The name actually used is returned as @code{finalName}.

An entry 
@code{.db[finalName]} is made containing the actual
dbfile instance created.

You will normally next create one or more packages
in the new dbfile by including the dbfile object
as the final argument to @code{]makePackage}.

If you want the new dbfile to be the home for a
new user, you should create them together

The @code{rootMakeUser} function creates and returns a new
instance of Class User.  This instance owns (only) itself.
A new dbfile is created for the new user:
the name of the new dbfile is as close to  @code{proposedDbfileName}
as practical.

In the interests of keeping the C-coded kernel as
policy-free as possible, @code{rootMakeUser} does nothing
beyond the above.  However, in the interest of sanity, it is
recommended that:

@enumerate
@item
A User instance be created only after
prompting for a name and passphrase and verifying that the
name is not present in @code{.u}.

@item
The new User's name and passphrase should be set immediately.

@item
The new User instance be immediately entered into .u under
its name.
@end enumerate

If several jobs may be entering new users, a lock should
of course be used to protect @code{.u}.  @xref{withLockDo}.

Newly created User objects default to having @code{.lib} as
their library of packages (@code{user$s.lib}), and
@code{.lib.muf} as their default package
(@code{usr$s.package}).  Since they won't own either, they
won't be able to create symbols in their accessable packages
nor create new packages: You will normally want to create a
new object as their @code{usr$s.lib}, copy into it the
system packages you feel to be appropriate, and most likely
also create them a personal package which they own (probably
giving it their login name as a name) and point their
@code{user$s.package} to it.

A higher level wrapper function exists to do much of
this work:  @xref{rootMakeAUser}.

@code{rootMakeAUser} itself, @xref{rootAddUser}.)

If there is a pre-existing user in @code{.u} with the given
name, an error message is issued and no new user is created.

A @code{user$s.lib} is created for the new user, and all
packages in @code{.lib} copied into it.  In addition, a new
package owned by (and named after) the user is created,
entered into @code{user$s.lib}, and @code{user$s.defaultPackage}
set to it: This is the package the user will be "in"
immediately after logging on.

Finally, @code{user$s.name} is set to the given name, and
@code{user$s.shell} set to @code{muf:oldMufShell}, the default
@sc{muf} shell.

After calling @code{rootMakeAUser}, you will frequently
wish to set @code{user$s.shell} to something more
appropriate, and also set @code{user$a.encryptedPassphrase}

The @sc{telnet} protocol is designed to allow client
and server programs to whisper back and forth without
distrupting user I/O on the connection, by using
special escape sequences flagged by an initial
@code{0xFF} byte.

Muq provides in-server support for @code{telnet}
protocol processing primarily in the form of code in
the socket object implementation which can split the
bytestream from the net into two in-db bytestreams, one
carrying vanilla user I/O to the shell, and one
carrying @sc{telnet} protocol commands to a separate
@sc{telnet} daemon implemented in-db in the
@code{telnet} package in @code{07-C-telnet.t}.

The current Muq telnet protocol support is a very rough
first draft: Among other deficiencies, @sc{tcp} urgent
data is not properly supported (meaning telnet commands
may not be communicated in as timely a fashion as they
should) and no options are supported, with the partial
exception of the @sc{echo} option.  All in good time.

These functions facilitate interaction with the user.
We will eventually need a fairly sophisticated mechanism
divorcing what is presented from how to present it;  For
now, we provide only a few essential low-level functions.

My past experience has indicated that the ability to compose
a display out of the following four basic classes of widgets
is sufficient to build simple but effective interfaces:

@enumerate
@item
Widget to allow text string entry.

@item
Widget to allow control of bounded integer variable.

@item
Widget to allow control of bounded float variable.

@item
Widget to allow selection of one of N strings.
@end enumerate

Additional specialized widgets, such as to allow selection
of a color from a color from a saturation hue intensity
colorspace, can certainly be welcome on occasion, but the
above four seem to suffice in general.

Thus first four functions in this section implement
these abilities in a form appropriate for use in
an @code{:interactiveFunction} for a @code{restart}.

Eventually, I would like to see a toolkit which allows an
application package to export an abstract interface
specifying things like "a parameter named 'speed' is
available which may be varied from 0.0 to 1600.0, with help
available as 'http://here/speed.html'", and then separate
interface packages while provide various commandline,
text-menu and graphical presentations of these interfaces.

(I feel strongly that Muq applications should not be
hardwired to present one particular end-user interface.
Content and presentation should be firmly separated.)

Anyone want to work up a proposal, or know of good
existing prior art in this area?

There are several hundred of them which are well documented elsewhere,
so I won't document them here.  (If anyone wants to volunteer to write
up Muq docs for them, that would be great!)  See the "Blue Book"

Noise functions map a point in space to a value between -1 and 1.
They are frequently used to create clouds and other irregular
shapes in computer graphics.

The fBM function has more knobs than most and is the granddady
of all noise functions, with analysis and use going back to
Benoit Mandelbrot's introduction of fractals to computer graphics.

The name originally came from "fractal Brownian motion" (I think)
but nowadays everyone just calls it @code{fBm}.

This version is from F. Kenton Musgrave's chapter in Texturing and
Modelling, A Procedural Approach.

See the book or the Muq source for full implementation details.

Basic raytracing primitive:  Given a ray at origin @code{O}
with direction vector @code{D} and a sphere given by center
@code{S} (all length-three vectors) and radius @code{r},
this function returns @code{nil,largevalue} if there was no intersection,
else the point of intersection @code{P} and the parametric ray
coordinate of the intersection, a scalar @code{s}.  (One often
uses @code{s} to check which of several candidate hits is in
fact first on the ray.)

Turbulence is a noise function which has been creased
by introducing an absolute-value computation: This
turns zero-crossings into discontinuities somewhat
reminiscent of the boundaries between eddys in turbulent
flow.  Turbulence functions are often used for modelling
explosions and such.

@code{lo} is the lowest frequency you want represented,
and @code{hi} is the highest -- there is no point in
exceeding pixel resolution in general.

Noise functions map a point in space to a value between -1 and 1.

[The volunteer who was going to complete the code in
this section never had time to do so, so it is not
included in the current version of the server.  I'll
be happy to cooperate with anyone else who wants to
volunteer to work on it.]

The functions described in this section constitutes a Muq
interface to the X Window System, following the CLX
(Common Lisp interface to X) standard as closely as
reasonable.

Examples are gathered into a separate section ("x
amples") rather than scattered through the individual
entries, because the X functions usually cannot be
briefly demonstrated in isolation.

@emph{These functions form an optional module and may
not be present in all versions of Muq.}

Note: These functions currently compile into package
@code{muf}, but will eventually move to package @code{xlib}.

The Muq X support library isn't complete enough to do a
lot as yet; The code so far was written primarily in
the hope of teasing someone else into contributing to
this project.  If that doesn't happen, I'll get back to
it once the rest of the server is in solid shape...

Here's a brief code sequence which exercises most of
what works so far.  It is intended to be executed
interactively line-by-line:

@example

( ConvenienceFor popping query-pointer stuff. )
: p8 pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop ; 

( Open display: )
"localhost:0" root-open-display --> display

( Find a screen on display: )
display display-roots[ |pop --> screen ]pop

( Find a color for foreground: )
screen screen-black-pixel --> fg-color

( Find a color for background: )
screen screen-white-pixel --> bg-color

( Find a font for text: )
display "8x13bold" open-font --> nice-font

( Find the root window for screen: )
screen screen-root --> window

( Query location of pointer on root window: )
window query-pointer

( Discard pointer information: )
p8

( Create a pen (gcontext) to draw with: )
[ :drawable window :foreground fg-color :background bg-color :font nice-font |
]create-gcontext --> gcontext 

( Create a white window of our very own: )
[ :enter-window :leave-window :button-press :button-release |
]make-event-mask --> event-mask
[ :parent window :x 10 :y 10 :width 200 :height 100 :background bg-color :event-mask event-mask |
]create-window --> our-window

( Make our window visible: )
our-window map-window   display flush-display

( Create a black window within our white window: )
[ :parent our-window :x 8 :y 8 :width 16 :height 16 :background fg-color :event-mask event-mask |
]create-window --> sub-window

( Make our subwindow visible: )
sub-window map-window   display flush-display

( Destroy our subwindow: )
sub-window destroy-window   display flush-display

( Draw some text in the window: )
[ our-window gcontext 10 20 "Hello world!" | ]draw-glyphs display flush-display
@end example

I expect Muq support for X to ramp up steadily over
time:  Once the basic @sc{clx} interface is in place,
we'll need support for one or more widget sets, for
example.  This is a nice, separable project for
anyone with the time and interest.

@c
@node Core Muf Wrapup, Muq Plans, x wrapup, Core Muf
@section Core Muf Wrapup

This concludes the Core Muf chapter.

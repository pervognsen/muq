                   muq/doc/#README#      last update: 95Mar17

Overview
--------

This directory contains source for the Muq manuals:

 admin  Administrator's guide to Muq.
 muf1   Elementary MUF programming tutorial aimed at nonprogrammers.
 muf2   Intermediate and Advanced MUF programming.
 muf3   Muf mastery, programmers, programming books, net resources.
 mufref Reference manual for MUF.
 src    Guide to the Muq source code.

Each of these is available pre-formatted in five formats:

 ascii  May be read via 'more' or printed on any hardcopy device.
 info   The GNU online format, readable via emacs, info, xinfo.
 .dvi   The TeX "DeVice Independent" format.
 .ps    Postscript for nice hard copy, derived from the above.
 .html  Hyper-Text Markup Language, read via WWWeb browsers.

The latter form are available directly on the WWWeb at
  http://betz.biostr.washington.edu/~jsp/muq/muq.html

In addition, filters exist to convert .dvi files to most other
high quality hardcopy formats.

You may obtain complete Muq manual sets in all the above
formats via anonymous-ftp from tf.tcp.com in pub/muq, the
current canonical Muq distribution point.  To reduce
distribution size, no preformatted manuals are included
in the source distribution proper.



More About Info Format
----------------------

Texi (texinfo) is the primary GNU documentation format;
documents written in it can be used to produce both online
and printed (via TeX) manuals.  'Info' is the online output.

Info documents can be displayed by a variety of tools,
including Xmosaic, emacs, info and xinfo.  The latter three
are available from any gnu ftp archive, such as
prep.ai.mit.edu.



If you have gnu emacs v19 or later installed on your system,
and set up your INFOPATH environment variable according to
the directions in the Muq INSTALLATION file, you should be
able to read the Muq docs in emacs simply by doing:
  M-x info

If you have gnu emacs v18 installed on your system, you
should be able to read the Muq documents via the emacs info
reader by doing (in emacs)

  M-Esc (setq Info-directory "~/muq/info")
  M-x info

where M-Esc is the 'Esc' key twice and 'M-x' is the 'Esc'
key followed by the 'x' key.

If you have a gnu emacs installed on your system but
are not sure which version it is, do:
  M-Esc emacs-version



If you have gnu 'info' and/or 'xinfo' installed on your
system, and set up your INFOPATH environment variable
according to the directions in the Muq INSTALLATION file,
you should be able to read the Muq docs simply by doing
'info' or 'xinfo'.



If you are a sysadmin, you can install the Muq docs in
your system's main info hierarchy by adding lines like

   * muf1:  (/usr/people/cynbe/muq/info/muf1).  Elementary MUF Tutorial.

(where the given path is the directory this #README# file is
in, plus 'muq') to the root info 'dir' file for your system,
which will likely be /usr/local/emacs/info/dir on older
systems and should be /usr/local/info/dir on most newer
systems.  (Under Linux, info is fully official and lives in
/usr/info/dir.)  If you do this, you can (and should) remove
the INFODIR hacks specified in Muq's INSTALLATION file from
your .login and .profile files.



If none of the above are usable on your system, you might
consider installing them yourself or nicely asking your
sysadmin if they can be installed.

If you are a virtual world builder and are sick of trying to do real work with toy
tools,
Muq may be what you've been looking for.
<p> 
Muq is animated (among other things) by a desire to construct secure, 
cooperative, democratic,
egalitarian, distributed online communities based on free software and 
user-owned hardware instead
of on proprietary commercial hardware and software. 
<P>
 Muq is not just another chip 
off the old 
block, but a total re-analysis, re-design and re-implementation of the
mudserver concept by someone who has been mudding for years
and implementing compilers, interpreters and software
environments for decades.

<P>
   Muq compiles code into true byte-coded executables,
   executed by a tuned interpreter with peak instruction
   issue rates several times that of the closest competitor.
   This means you can afford to code in-db things which
   you would have to code in-server on other servers.
   Furthermore, Muq executables demand-page in virtual memory
   just like everything else:  You can afford to have lots of 
   code in-db without bloating your process or slowing
   server startup.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Muq only loads into memory what you are actually
   using.  This means that your process size can be
   a tenth of your db size, opening doors other servers
   close in your face.  Muq's virtual memory support
   was designed in from day one, not awkwardly
   retrofitted, and uses a carefully tuned custom
   virtual memory module, not a generic database
   package, yielding unexcelled disk and ram performance.

<FONT COLOR="#FF6600"><H3><IMG SRC="pix.gif/stargold.gif"> True compacting

<BLOCKQUOTE>

   No more endlessly bloating processes or memory leaks!
   Other servers abuse malloc() shamelessly rather than
   implement a true ram management system like those
   used by production-quality Lisp and Smalltalk systems
   (or even Basics, for that matter).  Muq periodically
   compacts memory to free up wasted ram, potentially
   saving you hundreds or even thousands of dollars worth
   of ram.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF6600"><H3><IMG SRC="pix.gif/stargold.gif"> True incremental 
garbage collection</H3></FONT> <P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Modern programming environments like Smalltalk and Lisp
   automatically recover lost objects, so you don't have to
   waste time and effort worrying about memory leaks.  Muq
   does too, using an incremental algorithm so the server
   never stops long enough for you to notice.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>
   </P>

<FONT COLOR="#FF6600"><H3><IMG SRC="pix.gif/stargold.gif"> True policy-free 
virtual machine</H3></FONT> <P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

   Tired of fighting your server?  The C-coded Muq server
   implements just the functionality you need, while leaving
   policy issues to in-db code:  You can reconfigure Muq to
   be virtually anything you want, without touching a line of
   C code.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>
   <P>

<FONT COLOR="#FF6600"><H3><IMG SRC="pix.gif/stargold.gif"> True symbolic 
pathnames</H3></FONT> <P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   You will never type "#61422" in Muq.  You will never be
   embarassed explaining to a new user that objects are
   named by numbers, and one has to get used to writing them
   down.  You will never face the portability headaches
   posed by hardwired numeric dbrefs.  You will never feel
   as though you had been transported back to the software
   environments of the early 1950s, before the idea of
   symbolic names was introduced.
<P>
   Muq uses a variant of the familiar /usr/local/lib path
   notation used by unix and World Wide Web URLs, integrated
   with the package:symbol notation from Common Lisp -- two
   winning notations backed by untold hacker-millenia of
   testing and incremental refinement.  Paths may be
   expressed relative to the current job, current user,
   current object, current root, or any current variable,
   and may chain through any property on any object (subject
   to privilege checking).

 True user 
shells</H3></FONT> <P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

   Many servers hardwire the user interface into the server.
   Unix makes the user shell a separate unprivileged process,
   allowing users to individually select whatever interface
   style they wish.
<P>
   Muq does too: The user shells are coded entirely in-db
   and require no special privileges.  The standard Muq
   distribution provides a selection of shells, and in
   addition a number of third-party user shells have already
   been written, and it seems safe to say that more are on
   the way.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF6600"><H3><IMG SRC="pix.gif/stargold.gif"> True pre-emptive 
multitasking</H3></FONT> <P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Tired of servers that seem perpetually lagged?  Muq is
   carefully designed throughout to have a crisp, responsive
   feel, and as part of that implements a pre-emptive
   multi-tasking system similar to that universally used
   by production timesharing operating systems.  This means
   that simple user requests can get quick responses while
   more demanding user computations continue in the background.
<P>
   Muq jobs also communicate via streams which operate
   much like unix pipes extended to allow transmission
   of arbitrary values (instead of just a bytestream),
   allowing unix-style pipelines of jobs and trivial
   construction of in-db robots.  Unleash your imagination! :)

True contemporary first-class datastructures, including floats</H3></FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

   Tired of servers that seem to think that all the world's
   a string?  Muq provides a full range of modern datatypes
   and datastructures, including strings, integers, floats,
   arrays, Lisp-style lists, packages, symbols, stacks,
   streams, and objects with property directories.
<P>
   All value slots in Muq are first class:  Any value can
   be stored anywhere any other value can.

True contemporary programming languages</H3></FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

   Tired of trying to write real programs in toy languages?
   Tired of servers that offer you any language syntax you
   want, as long as it is X?
<P>
   Muq bytecode compilers are implemented in-db using an
   assembler class that handles most of the busywork and
   guarantees production of only valid executables, allowing
   new compilers to be written by unprivileged users.
<P>
   Muq already supports a variety of popular programming
   syntaxes including a large and growing subset of
   Common Lisp which should eventually be a complete,
   compatible implementation, allowing you to port
   code back and forth and to take advantage of existing
   code libraries.  If your syntactic religion isn't
   supported yet, it is not hard to add a compile for
   it as well, probably starting with one of the existing
   ones.
<P>
   At the semantic level, the Muq virtual machine provides
   just about everything you've heard of, and some things
   you may not have, including vanilla functions, generic
   functions, anonymous functions, promises with implicit
   forcing (in Scheme nomenclature -- a substrate suitable
   for experimenting with functional programming), thunks
   (something vaguely like named pipes in unix), semaphores
   for mutual exclusion, implicit job blocking on bounded
   streams, and sophisticated exception handling facilities.

True delegation-based object-oriented programming</H3></FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Experience has shown that classical object-oriented
   programming is a clumsy tool for rapid, experimental
   such as one tends to find in the mud environment.
<P>
   As a result, attention has been focussing recently on
   delegation-based system which dispense with indirection
   through classes, and instead attach methods directly to
   objects and allow objects to inherit directly from each
   other.
<P>
   Muq implements a delegation-based object system
   with multiple inheritance and message passing via
   generic functions, so simply that a new message
   may be interactively defined, implemented, and
   attached to an object in half a line of code.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

True multi-user protection</H3></FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   If you are like me, you want to empower the users
   of your virtual world while providing them a stable,
   reliable environment with real privacy where it
   counts -- and you resent servers so insecure that
   you are forced to choose between refusing programming
   privileges to most users, or else dispensing with any
   real expectation of reliability, security or privacy.
<P>
   Muq lets you have it both ways, by implementing
   serious multi-user protection inserver:  In a bare
   system, users can modify only datastructures which
   they own, and access only datastructures deliberately
   published by other users.  You provide additional
   means of interaction by providing system utilities,
   either from the standard distribution, third party
   libraries, or custom code you've written yourself.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

True incremental backup</H3></FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Tired of seeing interactions between dozens of users
   come to a screeching halt while the server checkpoints
   the db?  Muq does backups incrementally while user
   code continues to run -- one more may of improving
   interactive response.

True eight-bit strings, streams and network sockets</H3></FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Interested in multimedia applications or binary
   communication with other servers?  Muq strings
   may contain arbitrary eight-bit data, and Muq
   network sockets may be configured to pass eight-bit
   binary data by a simple parameter setting.  (By
   default, Muq sockets filter out various control
   characters, for security security-conscious users
   who prefer that.)

<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Tired of "minimal db"s full of stuff you don't want?
   Tired of core facilities which are impossibly difficult
   to update in an established db?  Tired of portability
   problems tranferring code between even matching servers?
<P>
   The Muq "minimal db" isn't even an empty file:  The server
   can create and initialize a blank db starting from nothing.
<P>
   System libraries are distributed as unix source files, and
   may be installed not at all, one at a time by hand, or en
   masse via one of the distributed scripts, according to your
   preference.  Install as much or as little as you please.
<P>
   Inside the db, code is segregated into Common Lisp style
   packages, making is a snap to remove an unwanted package
   if you change your mind.
<P>
   When system library updates come out, installing any
   library updates you wish is just as simple as the
   original installation.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Tired of tweaking config.h to get the server to compile?
   Muq autoconfigures and compiles on most major Unix
   variants (including Irix, OSF/1, Linux, Ultrix, SunOS,
   NeXTStep and AIX) with a simple "make".  Support for
   other unix variants is being added as quickly as I
   can get access to them.

True reliability</H3></FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Tired of daily bug reports?  Tired of discovering the
   hard way that it didn't install right?  Tired of
   servers that leave reliability to chance?  That look
   like throwaway toys written by undergrads?
<P>
   Muq was developed from day one with the design goal of
   production-quality reliability, and the willingness to
   invest the work needed to make it happen.
<P>
   The regression test suite has been developed hand-in-hand
   with the server implementation, and each software layer
   in Muq has been thoroughly tested before starting
   implementation of the next layer.  There are thousands of
   lines of code inside and outside the server devoted
   exclusively to selfcheck.
<P>
   The regression suite has been used constantly throughout
   development to catch bugs promptly and efficiently, and
   is available to you for use in verifying that Muq is
   functioning correctly on your system.  If the complete
   Muq selftest runs without reporting any problems, you
   have reasonable assurance that you have a good install.
<P>
   Finally, the policy-free server design means that you
   can implement almost all needed local customizations
   entirely in-db, vastly reducing the incidence of locally
   generated crashing bugs.

      You can extend additional privileges as needed by
      supplying setuid-root functions, which can be written

Thu Jun 26 02:14:31 1997  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* ~!@#@!! :( :( :( ... texinfo.tex is now crashing on
	@xref{} to any node name containing | < >.  I either
	have to learn enough TeX and take enough time to fix
	the damn thing, or else pick strange paraphrased node
	names for all such operators :( :( :(.  Unless I write
	some extra macros, this will screw up the node names
	in ascii, HTML and info docstyles too, not just the
	tex-produced ones.  Yeesh...

	Date: Fri, 17 Mar 1995 20:25:20 -0600 (CST)
	From: "PakRat and Artie Productions Ltd." <pakrat@csd.uwm.edu>
	To: Muq List <muq>
	Subject: :)
	Just for Muq historical reference when we are old farts chewing the fat
	talking about how great Muq is in years to come, today is the day the
	'first' Muq home site has switched to link to the 'first official' Muq
	home site. *giggle*
	-Andy

	* Discovered that replacing the muq-texi2html line
            eval($subst_code);
	by inlined value of '$subst_code' cuts peak process size
	when formatting mufref.texi from 140Meg to 5Meg :)

	* The Muq indices all seem to work ok now.  Whee! :)

	* Experimented a bit and discovered that
	    @findex @minus{}
	is a great way to get TeX/texinfo to toss its cookies.
	Which seems to fit the general rule of text formatting
	packages disliking formatting commands anywhere but in
	vanilla running text :-/
	  Curiously,
	    @findex @code{->}
	seems fine.

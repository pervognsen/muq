Q: How do I pronounce 'Muq'?

A: Rhymes with "Hook".
   Try saying "I took a look in the Muq-book"
   ten times rapidly. :)



Q: What does 'Muq' mean?

A: <mysterious smile>



Q: Is is true Muq has everything but the kitchen sinks in-server?

A: No, this is a base canard spread by unspeakably slimy competitors.
   Muq has had a fully functional, POSIX-compliant kitchen-sinks
   operator since version -2.4, 94Mar26.



Q: Be serious.

A: Muq is a micro-kernel design.  Everything sensible has been moved
   from the server into the db, including the user shells and the
   compilers.  That just happens to leave hundreds of operators in
   the kernel still:
     327 prims built implementing 57 primary opcodes (7 free)
     and 223 secondary opcodes (33 free).
   (94Mar26 figures.)
     380 prims built implementing 63 primary opcodes (1 free)
     and 278 secondary opcodes (746 free).
   (94Oct29 figures.)
     674 prims built implementing 65 primary opcodes (63 free)
     and 568 secondary opcodes (456 free).
   (97Jan02 figures.)


Q: Do I need all of vm1 - vm4 that make-db-c creates?  Which one
   does it actually use?

A: vm0 contains the currently running db, which will be invalid
   after a crash, hence can't be counted on.

   vm1 contains the db as it existed before the current run started.
   vm2 contains the db as it existed before the last    run started
   (And so forth.)

   The number of versions kept is controlled by VM_MAX_DB_COPIES_TO_KEEP,
   and may be changed by defining VM_MAX_DB_COPIES_TO_KEEP in your
   h/Site-config.h and recompiling (you might have to "touch vm.c" also).

   You may also control this parameter via /muq/#/max-db-copies-to-keep.



Q: Why can't I do "nanomud:*world*, " from a nanomud login?

A: Each user has a private library of "known" packages, called
   ~%s/lib.  The nanomud package is initially known to root,
   but not to other users.  (This might or might not be a bug.)
   You can do
     , /u<"root">%s/lib<"nanomud"> --> ~%s/lib<"nanomud">
   to add nanomud to your library, after which nanomud:*world*
   will evaluate as expected.



Q: Why does the Muq mufshell hang after I type ^D at the console?

A: ^D is usually the "eof" (end of file) character under Unix.
   Its behavior is controlled by the Unix terminal driver, and
   I'm not sure Muq should be altering its behavior behind the
   user's back.  You can change the eof char using stty at the
   unix shell prompt:
       stty eof ^-       # One way to disable the 'eof' feature. ^- is 2 chars.
       stty eof undef    # Another way to disable the 'eof' feature.
       stty eof 256      # Another way to disable the 'eof' feature.
       stty eof 0        # The way to disable eof on some older unix systems.
       stty eof 255      # Sets eof to a char hard to type by accident.
       stty eof ^D       # This will restore it. '^D' is two chars here.
       stty eof 4        # Same as above.
       stty -a           # Display all terminal mode settings.
       stty sane         # Set terminal driver to a sane mode.



Q: Does Muq have a Year 2,000 problem?
A: No.  Muq -does- have a Year 29,653,302 problem, but don't
   worry:  We're on track to have a solution shipped in time.

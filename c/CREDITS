/* {{{ CREDITS -- Influences on Muq.				*/



Muq's immediate genealogy includes a number of my previous projects,
most notably Tetra, an RPN, byte-coded, message-passing, object
oriented, text-windowing, virtual memory system I implemented in BDS C
for CP/M circa 1981.  The 48Kbyte ram limit killed it in the end.
Paging off SSSD floppies wasn't too fast either *wrygrin*.  I
named it "Tetra" in honor of a little school of Neon Tetras I
once hosted:  May I someday have software tools so individually
elegant that work together so effortlessly!



Thanks to:

Andy/Artie/Pakrat for unflagging support and
enthusiasm through my long years of solitary
coding of the initial Muq kernel.  Healso wrote
the first unixy user shell for Muq (psh) and the
first third-party assembler for Muq, in the
process reporting more bugs than everyone else
combined early on, along with contributing many
good suggestions.

Bookwyrm/Kim for being a leading early tester,
writing the first worldkit for Muq, providing much
encouragement, and genially suffering through
early incompatible server changes, and reporting
any number of early bugs, not to mention providing
a number of design ideas.

Codrus, for suggesting thunks and being endlessly
supportive and patient with me while Muq was being
written.

CaveMUCK, collectively and Jingoro especially:
good friends and a bottomless well of technical
expertise at need.

Cessna, for various alpha-testing contributions including
bug reports and documentation suggestions.

Dyjkstra, for (e.g.,) the three-color garbage
collection algorithm which Muq adapts.

Explorer_Bob, for useful discussions and ideas
centering on coldmud.

Evil Geniuses for a Better Tomorrow, ResearchMUCK,
and the UCSD Secret Islandia Club, like the
related CaveMUCK crowd, good friends and technical
resources alike.

Firiss, who more than anyone shaped my understanding of
mud administration ethics and praxis, and who is possibly
the finest person I've ever met.  I fondly remember endless
companionable hours shared online.

Foxen, for being implacably genial, and for her
work on fuzzball, which has contributed to both
the presence and absence of various design
features in Muq.

The FurryMuck community for demonstrating the
requirements and problems of a large, long-lived
online community.

Gcc, the program and the team:  It's superb diagnostics
saved untold hours of debugging time, its "long long"
support allowed an early transition to 64-bit operation,
avoiding a painful 32-to-64-bit transition on an installed
base, and its portability brough Muq to machines Muq would
otherwise never have run on.

Islandia, unknown and unforgotten: Someday someone
will write your story!  Meanwhile, I sit on the
ledge below Unicorn Point, gazing out to sea,
thinking wistfully of that which was, and dreaming
of that which might yet be...

Jin (Stan Lim) for MicroMUSE, my very first mud
and another paradigm case of a large, long-lived
mud, courtesy in part of MIT sponsorship: Too
few universities show such courage.

Alan Kay, whose ideas and creations have been a
longtime inspiration to me, from the Reactive
Engine to, for example, his design principle
"Simple things should be simple; Complex things
should be possible.", with a particular nod to
Smalltalk and the entire Xerox PARC crew who
contributed to it... "The implementor must cheat,
but not get caught".

Donald Knuth, for contributing so ridiculously
much that I take for granted, from the LR parsing
which compiles all my code to the O() notation in
which I think about my code, from the Art Of
Computer Programming from which I learned much of
what I know about programming one summer
(including the B-trees Muq uses for propdirs) --
I'm still awaiting Volume Four *Grin* -- to the
"literate programming" philosophy and examples
which inform my source code style to the TeX
package that prints my documentation, including
the informal correctness reasoning internal to
TeX, which I've yet to properly master...

OliverJones, for knowing everything I need to, and
being willing to explain any of it to me as many
times as I asked... :) Also for generously sharing
tinyMuck2.3 code with me.  And for one of the best
retrospective tours of Islandia I've yet had!

Jerry Prothero, my brother, for consistent support
and encouragement over years of Muq development,
and providing a genial and responsive sounding
board for megabytes of related rants and musings.

Robert Recorde, for introducing the '=' sign.  Muq
couldn't have been written without it.  It's handy
in math, too. *grin*

Dan Root, for the Muq logo, for the entire
Protomuq project, and for hosting the Muq mailing
lists.

Richard M Stallman who, despite his cc having
eclipsed mine *grin*, I admire as a visionary in
an age not equipped to appreciate him.  When I get
email from him, I feel like Moses recieving stone
tablets *giggle*.  Beyond more obvious rms/FSF
debts, Muq's design has been deeply influenced by
the design and implementation of emacs.

Guy L Steele, Gerald Sussman, and the other
contributors to Scheme, which I have used as one
reference model for Muq semantics... I've been a
fan of Steele for many years now; Our paths seem
to keep crossing, from Lambda to Lisp to Loglan.

Sandy Stone, my flipside, for too many things to
list: The snazzy rewrite of the Muq sales brochure
will have to serve as sole sample.

TimeTraveller and Qwest (in particular), for
providing my formative mudding experiences.  Is it
really possible to love ten thousand people? :)
Thousands of online hours with hundreds of online
friends left me with both fond memories and a
conviction that online communities are worthwhile
now and can grow into something even more so: Muq
is my attempt to contribute to that growth.

Unix and its progenitors.  Just having 'core' dumps
saved untold hours relative to debugging on (say)
MS-DOS.

Whitedove, most directly for being one of the
first test victims of the MUF tutorial, providing
much welcome feedback.

Whitefire, for many thought-provoking discussions
and suggestions on mud design, not a few of which
have directly inspired parts of Muq, such as the
distinction of user from avatar objects.  It often
takes me a month to see why he's right and I'm
wrong :).

Zarisky, for telling me much of what I know about
Islandia, and giving me perhaps a better sense of
its ambience than anyone else.  We'll disregard
the incident of the doctored wine... :)



Generally, to the various preceding
mud/muck/moo/... server hackers whose ideas I have
shamelessly stolen, and even more generally to the
larger community which has created such exemplars
as unix, lisp and smalltalk from which to steal.
I hope Muq will return a little to the communal
pot from which I've fed these many years.



All design and coding flaws in Muq are purely my
fault.  So far :).

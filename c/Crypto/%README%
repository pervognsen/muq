This directory contains Muq's crypto stuff.

Use muq/bin/muq-exportable to remove all crypto stuff from Muq before
exporting it from the US or Canada or such.

You can then download muq-crypto-src.tar.gz from a Free World site
such as ftp://ftp.cistron.nl/pub/people/cynbe to restore security
to the exported version.

The copy of jobd.t in this directory is the NON-crypto version.
(muq-exportable uses it to replace the crypto-enabled muq/c/jobd.t).

The remaining files in this directory are currently a stock
distribution of Bruce Schneier's mid-98 twofish implementation
submitted to NIST in the AES competition to pick a successor
to DES (the US Data Encryption Standard).

Currently (98Oct) twofish may be obtained from

  http://www.counterpane.com

if you are inside the United States, otherwise from the Free
World sites

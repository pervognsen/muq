A fuzzball fix that might someday apply to Muq:

Problem: Compiling FB under Linux with gcc 2.6.x using -g (the default)
                gives an internal compiler error and asks for "libc.so.4".
                This is common with Slackware releases 2.2.x and 2.3.x.

Reason: Nonexistent "libg.sa"
Remedy: As root, make libg.sa by

                # cd /usr/lib; ln -s libc.sa libg.sa

Note: If you already have a softlink from libg.sa to libg.a, and you still
                have problems, rm that link, then retry the above commands.

This directory contains muf selfcheck code which is appropriate to
test all configurations of the Muq server.

begin.muf and end.muf are convenience functions used by all the other
files; x-*muf are the actual selfcheck files.

To add more selfcheck code, just create another x-*muf file;
bin/muq-opt-checkmuf will find and run it.

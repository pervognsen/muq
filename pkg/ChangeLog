Wed Jan 27 01:42:31 1999    <cynbe@laurel.muq.org>

	* 190-C-muqnet.t: Updated 
	   *_GET_MUQNET_USER_INFO
	   *_GET_USER_INFO
	   *_SET_USER_INFO
	to propagate the new user%s fields
	   doing
	   doNotDisturb
	   email
	   homepage
	   pgpKeyprint
	as part of the automatically mirrored per-user info.
	Main point is to allow fast @who hacks which user only
	information on the local server, and to propagate
	globally information needed for contact via alternate
	media -- so that, e.g., if a muqnet node crashes, one
	has access to an email address.
	
Sun Jan 10 12:03:39 1999    <cynbe@laurel.muq.org>

	* 190-C-muqnet.t: userVersion information added to
	User+Guest objects and to muqnet packets, and muqnet
	daemon requests information when it sees an incoming
	userverion greater than its cached one:  Should get
	us most of the way to supporting dynnamic IP addresses.

Fri Nov 13 23:22:15 1998    <cynbe@laurel.muq.org>

	* 190-C-muqnet.t: Discovered several places in 'run'
	where error handling 'if' clauses failed to pop the
	packet off the stack, leading to eventual datastack
	overflow.
  	  The error recovery logic mostly masked this.  :-/
  	  The arity checking didn't catch it because it can't
	handle daemon functions which never return.

Sun Oct  4 08:00:52 1998  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* 385-W-oldhas-been-ejected.t: Created.

	* 330-W-oldmud: Added HAS_BEEN_EJECTED message.

Sun Sep  6 09:56:42 1998  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* 475-W-oldmsh-look.t:  The REQ_VIEW invocation in
	lookAtSomething had been correctly changed to expect
	'err strId strLen short' return values, but the
	invocation in lookAtCurrentRoom was still expecting
	only 'strId strLen' in that zone.
  	   This resulted in the NIL 'err' return value being
	read as a nil strId (no such description available),
	and in the short description being used instead (which
	resulted in the results looking reasonable).
	   This bug must date to the addition of the extra
	'err' and 'short' return values sometime earlier this
	year;  It escaped this long due in part to the fallback
	code making results look reasonable.
	   More care in making sure I'd updated all REQ_VIEW
	invocations might have prevented it.
	   A language with stronger argument checking than Muq
 	MUF could have caught the bug at compile time.
	   This could be a warning that as we make software more
	fault-tolerant, it becomes easier for faults to evade
	detection.  :(

	* 475-W-oldmsh-short.t:  Hacked to call
	    updateShortDescInRoomCache
	when changing short description.
	
	* 402-W-oldroom-cache2.t: Added a new function
	    updateShortDescInRoomCache
 	to help update at least the local cache after updating
	a short description -- it was really disconcerting to
	change the short description on a local object and then
	do a look and see it unchanged due to the local room
 	cache being unaware of the update.

	* 347-W-oldrequest.t: Verified that all '*TimeoutFn'
	re-use old taskId rather than assigning a new one,
	when submitting new continuation.  This is important
	because otherwise any request with a round-trip delay
	exceeding the retry time might never succeed -- the
	returning taskId wouldn't be recognized.

	* 190-C-muqnet.t: For clarity, renamed
 	    REQ_MUQNET_USER_INFO -> REQ_GET_MUQNET_USER_INFO
	    ACK_MUQNET_USER_INFO -> ACK_GET_MUQNET_USER_INFO
	    doReqMuqnetUserInfo  -> doReqGetMuqnetUserInfo
	    doAckMuqnetUserInfo  -> doAckGetMuqnetUserInfo
	    sendMuqnetUserInfo   -> sendGetMuqnetUserInfo
	(I thought "sendMuqnetUserInfo" was particularly misleading,
	since it in fact requests information rather than sending it.)
	
Sat Sep  5 07:06:54 1998  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* 190-C-muqnet.t: Went through the doReq* and doAck*
	functions changing '|writeStreamPacket's to
	'|maybeWriteStreamPacket's.
  	  I believe the change is needed in the doReq's to prevent
 	possible deadlock when the muqnet daemon is writing to its
 	own input queue	and the queue is full.
	  I believe the change is needed in the doAck's to prevent
	the muqnet daemon from locking up if some user daemon crashes
	and its messate stream fills up.
	  I didn't make the change in the send* functions, because
	having user daemons block until they can write the muqnet
	queue shouldn't be a problem -- I'm assuming the muqnet daemon
	is reliable and rarely takes long to process a packet.
	  I didn't make the change in the muqnet:]run writes to the
	network because I'm similarly presuming the host kernel is
	reliable and will send (or drop) UDP packets out promptly,
	hence that a write to a UDP socket will never block for long.
	  I've seen an occasional apparent lockup during x[xy]-oldmud2
	test runs, I'm hoping one of the above fix it.  Or else to avoid
	having to track down and fix the above problems the hard way! :)

	* 190-C-muqnet.t: This might possibly be an over-optimization:
	Stopped storing sharedSecret except on local users. (Since one
	participant in every muqnet communication must be a local user,
	seems no reason to store shared secrets on guest user records.)

	* Changed 'password' to 'passphrase' everywhere.

	* (100-C-utils, 490-W-root-oldmud.t):  Changed (useless)
	old "zz" password encryption salt to lowercase name of
	user.

	* 345-W-oldtask.t (defclass home): Changed initial value
	of taskNextId to be a negative trulyRandomFixnum instead
	of 1:  This is intended to help with eventual checking
	for duplicate requests in non-idempotent muqnet request
	handlers.

Thu Aug 20 21:22:47 1998  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* Changed 'compiledFunction?' to 'callable?' almost everywhere.
	
	* Changed #'fn to 'fn most places to improve maintainability.

Thu Jul 30 17:44:26 1998  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* Continuation functions passed to ]request now get
	passed another argument when called:  A 'from' value
	which is the authenticated identity of the respondent.
	This will be clutter most of the time, but it is good
	information to make readily available, I think.

	* 347-W-oldrequest.t: Various nice tweaks to the
 	task/request machinery:
	  'why' field can be specified, giving text name to task.
	  'who' field can be specified, in which case any replies
	        from anyone else (as established by the new public-
	        key based authentication logic) are ignored.
	  ]request now automatically specifies 'who' (== 'to').
	This basically completes the job of automatically authenticating
	most Micronesia interactions between users.
	
Mon Jul 27 22:19:52 1998  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* 345-W-oldtask.t: Discovered taskDelay still had a
	default initial value of 1, reasonable when the time
	currency was seconds, silly now that it is microseconds.
	Another bug dating back to the time currency change-over
	half a year ago.

Sat Jul 18 12:08:33 1998  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* 190-C-muqnet.t: Discovered getVal and getValP were
	still using a retry timeout in seconds (2) instead of
	milliseconds.  This bug dated back to the secs -> millisecs
	change-over in Jan/Feb.

Thu Jun 11 19:55:17 1998  Jeff Prothero  <jsp@chee.muq.org>

	* 175-C-rex.t: Matched substrings were being returned in reverse
	order.  Traced this to the fact that paren-pair numbering was being
	done during the compile treewalk rather than during the parse, and
	the treewalk happened to be going in reverse order.

  	The compiletreewalk should be free to process in any order, so
 	doing numbering during it is simply wrong:  It happened due to
 	my laziness in not wanting to pass a special state record around
	during parsing (to contain the number of paren-pairs seen so
	far).  It survived due to my testing individual cases but no test
	cases complex enough to contain two paren-pairs.

Wed Jun 10 19:55:17 1998  Jeff Prothero  <jsp@chee.muq.org>

	* Muq v -1.42.0 release.
	
1998-04-16    <cynbe@al.muq.org>

	* x-skt was failing test 34 in x-skt (open datagram socket) for
	some reason under Red Hat 5.0 on Nec 6000H laptop: switched from
	port 62121 to 60127 and things worked fine.  Something on 62121?
	(Rebooting made no difference.)

Fri Jan 23 21:01:45 1998  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* Changed MUF compiler to be case-sensitive.  My semantic
	base reference, CommonLisp, frowns on this, but Perl, C,
	Java and most contemporary programmers like case-sensitive
	identifiers, so having MUF follow suit should ease inter-
	operation. (If not with Perl/C/Java/... proper, then with
	emulations of them written for Muq.)
	
Tue Dec 30 06:17:35 1997    <cynbe@xx>

	* 370-W-oldisle.t:  quay-janitor-task wasn't checking for
	special case of no known isles, leading to an attempt to
	read stack<-1>, which aint kosher...

Sun Dec  7 13:36:29 1997  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* 370-W-oldisle.t: Added quay-janitor-task to automatically remove
	proas headed to currently offline worlds.

	* 370-W-oldisle-list.t: Proa construction more robust and extensive.

Sun Nov 30 23:57:50 1997  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* 475-W-oldmsh-quit.t: Added hack so on @quit, avatar leaves room
	for limbo instead of cluttering up the place.

Sun Nov 30 06:42:35 1997  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* -1.40.0 release.

Mon Nov 10 18:55:21 1997  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* Heh, walked back and forth between two Muq oldworlds on
 	different machines. :)

Sun Sep 28 14:59:13 1997  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* 337-W-oldpub.t Created.  Task/request functionality finally
	seems beaten into shape, moving on to string publication support.

Sat Jul 12 03:47:24 1997  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* Switched from two-digit to three-digit numeric prefixes --
	oldmud was getting crowded.  More fun than renumbering old
	BASIC programs, even :).

Sun Jul  6 01:13:26 1997  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* 10-C-utils.t: Added 'debug-on' and 'debug-off' convenience
	functions to set/clear @%s/break-enable, just because I can
	remember 'debug-on' and 'debug-off' but not '@%s/break-enabe' :)

Fri Jul  4 13:08:40 1997  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* 12-C-muf.t: Pass line numbers to assembler for use by debugger.

	* 14-C-init-shell.t:  Moved rc2 code here from 10-C-utils.t

	* 14-C-init-shell.t:  Create, moved init-shell code here from 12-C-muf.t

	* 14-C-muf-shell.t:  Created, moved muf-shell code here from 12-C-muf.t

	* Changed cynbe@eskimo.com &tc to cynbe@muq.org everywhere I
	caught them.

Thu Jan  2 00:03:03 1997  Cynbe ru Taren  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* 30-X-nanomud.t: Hacked 'start' to ignore attempts
	to start the nanomud login daemon if it is already
	running.  (Pakrat pointed out that this was too easy
	to do, and resulted in confusing behavior.)

Wed Jan  1 22:15:14 1997  Cynbe ru Taren  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* 13-C-muf-syntax.t: 'compile-(' had
	    |length 0 = if ]pop loop-next fi ( Don't crash on empty lines )
	where it really needed
	    |length 0 = if ]pop return fi    ( Don't crash on empty lines )
	which was resulting in ')' not being recognized
	as an end-of-comment if it was at the start of a line.
	(Thanks to Andrew Bolt for pointing out this one.)

	* 12-C-muf.t: Fixed: 'compile-path' had
	    c '%' = if
		[ ctx/mss '/' | |scan-token-to-char
	where it needed
	    c '%' = if
		[ ctx/mss "/<" | |scan-token-to-chars
	which resulted in it not understanding
	stuff like "~%s/login-hints%h<1>".  (Kudos to
	Pakrat for catching out that bug!)
	
	
Tue Dec 31 20:26:38 1996  Cynbe ru Taren  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* 10-C-utils.t: Introduced variables
	    muf:*telnet-port-offset*
	    muf:*nanomud-port-offset*
	to bring a little more rationality to Muq internal
	daemon port assignment configuration by replacing
	the previously hardwired integer constants.  These
	are intended to be used as integer offsets from
	/sys%s/muq-port.

	* 19-C-muqnet.t: Created.

Sat Dec 21 20:39:50 1996    <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* Moved to attic:
	      26752 Oct 21 22:10 28-W-cl.t
	       4754 Oct 21 22:11 28-W-elisp.t
	       6332 Oct 21 22:11 28-W-scene.t
	      15914 Oct 21 22:12 28-W-xlib.t

Wed Dec 18 23:28:11 1996    <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* 12-C-muf.t: Added 'init-shell' fn for daemon mode startup.

	* 10-C-utils.t: Added 'rc2' fn for daemon mode startup.

Sun Dec 15 12:39:22 1996    <cynbe@muq.org>

	* 35-W-oldmsh.t: Added reporting of last backup.

	* 12-C-muf.t:    Added reporting of last backup.

Sun Dec 15 11:41:19 1996    <cynbe@muq.org>

	* 35-W-oldmsh.t: Added reporting of last garbage collect.

	* 12-C-muf.t:    Added reporting of last garbage collect.

Sat Dec 14 20:48:04 1996    <cynbe@muq.org>

	* Rewrote oldmud to use switch-job rather than
	"1 sleep-job" on login and logout, eliminating
	the irritating 1-sec delays.  There is still
	probably a race condition there which should
	be fixed someday, ideally.  But failure on the
	logout race condition just results in logoff
	message not being seen, and failure on the input
	one just results in echoing being off after
	login.

	* 10-C-utils.t: Damn! -- Just wasted a day and a
	half of prime programming time discovering in the
	hardest possible way that the reason there was a
	one-second delay on login to the oldmud is because...
	there's a "1 sleep-job" in root-login-user. *BLUSH*!!

Sun Dec  8 18:05:32 1996    <cynbe@muq.org>

	* 15-C-defclass.t: Added
	    :prot "rw----"
	option to defclass -- got sick of seeing stuff like
	    :user-may-read  t	:user-may-write  t
	    :class-may-read nil	:class-may-write nil
	    :world-may-read nil	:world-may-write nil
	littering all my class declarations.

Thu Nov 21 01:35:50 1996    <cynbe@muq.org>

	* 10-C-utils.t: Added function
	    ]root-exec-user-daemon
	as a convenience function for
	root-oldmud:root-start-world-daemons.
	
Tue Nov 19 22:06:52 1996    <cynbe@muq.org>

	* 34-W-oldmsh.t ]shell: Wyatt pointed out that
	a crash within REQUEST-WAKE was leaving us in
	the debugger with no valid restarts.  Rewrote
	the code to put the REQUEST-WAKE call inside
	the shell boilerplate.

	* 33-W-oldmud.t: Introduced class CONTAINER and
	switched to linking avatars to container
	room/ears instead of directly to room, opening
	the way for rooms to contain more than one list
	of objects, and for rooms and avatars to contain
	each other if desired.

Mon Nov 18 01:02:19 1996    <cynbe@muq.org>

	* 10-C-utils.t: Wyatt pointed out that
	    root-login-user
	was crashing into the root prompt when given
	a null password.  Most unpleasant!  Added a
	special check for null passwords, and in
	addition converted root-login-user to a dumb
	shell, to avoid future bugs crashing it into
	a root-privileged mufshell prompt.

Sun Nov 17 19:18:20 1996    <cynbe@muq.org>

	* 07-C-telnet.t: Added
	    maybe-will-echo
	    maybe-wont-echo
	which work on telnet connections and
	at least don't generate errors from console.
	
	* 10-C-utils.t: Added
 	    change-password
 	    root-change-password
 	functions, and root-config-menu entries calling them.
	
	* 10-C-utils.t: PakRat pointed out usernames with
	capital letters weren't working.  Added a string-
	downcase or two to root-login-user and also to
	root-add-user and root-oldmud:root-add-user.

	* 12-C-muf.t: ]shell was showing hints after each
	error as well as at login.  Moved show-login-hints
	call above the abrt tag.

	* 10-C-utils.t: config functions now "Hrm?" when
	they don't understand input. (Pakrat pointed out
	the lack of a NAK was confusing.)

Sat Nov 16 13:54:04 1996    <cynbe@muq.org>

	* 10-C-utils.t: Added two convenience functions
	    add-config-fn
	    config
	by way of establishing a standard mechanism for
	packages to make configuration menus available
	to the user.

	* 10-C-utils.t: Added two convenience functions
	    show-login-hints
	    add-login-hints
	by way of establishing a standard mechanism for
	packages to post helpful reminders.

Wed Nov  6 23:04:05 1996    <cynbe@muq.org>

	* 25-C-debugger.t: Changed to silenly ignore
	empty lines, which it tends to inherit from
	mufshell.

Fri Nov  1 02:48:38 1996    <cynbe@muq.org>

	* 25-C-debugger.t: SHOW-STACKFRAME was trying to
	interpret numbered entries in handler frames as local
	variable slots in normal frames, and consequently
	crashing.

Tue Oct 22 00:38:18 1996    <cynbe@muq.org>

	* 10-C-utils.t: Added root-accept-logins and
	root-accept-logins-on functions, trivially
	adapted from nanomud.
	
	* 10-C-utils.t: Added root-add-user function.

Mon Oct 21 22:31:16 1996    <cynbe@muq.org>

	* 32-W-oldmud.t:  Created, from nanomud.
	* 33-W-oldmsh.t:  Created, from nanomsh.

	* Did some file renumbering.

Sat Oct  5 13:46:37 1996    <cynbe@muq.org>

	* 41-X-nanomsh.t: Renamed packages
	    mud  to   nanomud
	    msh  to   nanomsh
	to make room for eventual production mud
	and mudshell packages.

Thu Jul 25 23:49:34 1996    <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* 12-C-muf.t: Fixed: compile-file had no 'abort handler,
	leading to disaster after any compile error.
	
Thu Jul 18 22:24:25 1996    <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* 10-C-utils.t: Fixed: root-become-user failed to
	change ownership of both of the main message streams:
	This bug dates back to introduction of mss%s/twin prop.
	(Thanks to Loki for reporting this and previous bug.)
	
	* 10-C-utils.t: Fixed: root-make-a-user was still
	referencing the (long-dead) /etc/lib/zil shell.

Wed Jun  5 02:46:32 1996    <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* 12-C-muf.t: Baby's first words -- Compiles 2 2 + for first time :)

Fri Nov 10 01:28:33 1995  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* Various changes like 
	    ~%s/lib<"muf"><"fork-jobset"> not if
	->
	    ~%s/lib<"muf"> "fork-jobset" get? pop not if
	to accomodate changed 'get' semantics.

Sun Nov  5 17:29:30 1995  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* -1.26.0 release

Sun Nov  5 00:52:21 1995  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* 40-mud.t: Hacked find-avatar to suppress password echoing.

Sat Nov  4 22:40:44 1995  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* 41-mudshell.t: Hacked run-shell to call maybe-start-telnet-daemon.

	* 10-C-utils.t: Created maybe-start-telnet-daemon, hacked
	muf-shell to call it.

Sun Oct 29 01:14:54 1995  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* 07-C-telnet.t: Created, to hold in-db telnet protocol code.

Thu Oct 12 00:11:17 1995  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* 40-mud.t start-mud: Updated ]root-listen-for-sockets
	to use new :socket parameter instead of discontinued
	:message-stream parameter.

Sun Sep 17 16:54:03 1995  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* 10-C-utils.t: Various minor edits implementing the
	    job%s/terminal-input + job%s/terminal-output -> job%s/terminal-io
	    job%s/debug-input    + job%s/debug-output    -> job%s/debug-io
	    job%s/query-input    + job%s/query-output    -> job%s/query-io
	change-over.  40-mud.t and 15-C-debugger.t had a few edits too.

	* 10-C-utils.t: Added 'make-bidirectional-message-stream'.

Fri Sep 15 21:50:02 1995  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* 10-C-utils.t: Phased out write-stream-by-chunks in favor of
	]write-stream-by-lines

Sat Sep  2 15:02:38 1995  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* 15-C-debugger.t show-stacktrace:  Added line number display
	per request from Pakrat.

Sat Sep  2 00:02:30 1995  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* 15-C-debugger.t: Added 'show-disassembly' driven by "Unassemble" cmd.

	* 15-C-debugger.t: Added 'disassemble-compiled-function'.

Fri Sep  1 21:32:38 1995  Jeff Prothero  <cynbe@chee.muq.org>

	* 10-C-utils.t root-become-user: Pakrat pointed out that
	it wasn't doing a "user cd", which is clearly called for. Fixed.

		muq/pub/#README#

This directory holds host unix files accessable to the Muq
server.

Restricting Muqserver file access to this directory is
intended to limit the security damage of a cracked Muq
server while providing most of the benefits of host
filesystem access.

Note that files that live elsewhere can be made available to
the Muq server by adding a hard or soft link to them here.

Muq will ignore all filenames in this directory except those
consisting only of lowercase letters, digits, and the dash
character.  This is intended to be flexible enough for
readability while being strict enough to close security
holes like ".cshrc" "/etc/passwd" "../../../etc/passwd" and
such.

You still need to watch for problems such as files with
"eval:" lines at the end that might get evaluated by your
emacs.

This directory contains programs which may
be invoked as co-processes by in-db Muq
code.

Since in general the Muq server may be hosting
guests not trusted at the unix host level, the
following restrictions are enforced:

Server names must contain only letters and
dashes.  This is to avoid tricks involving
leading '.' or '../' or nonprinting chars
or whatever.

Server names starting with "root-" may only
be executed by in-db Muq jobs executing
with in-db root as the effective user.

           ############
           # WARNING! #
           ############

Putting ill-considered programs in this
directory may completely breach the
security wall between the Muq server
process and the host account.

For example:

Obviously, putting a shell like sh
csh ksh tcsh or such in here will allow
any job in the Muq server full run of
the host account.

Perhaps less obviously, many Unix
utilities contain '!' escapes to
run a subshell:  vi, mail ...
Placing any of these in this
directory will likewise allow
any job in the Muq server full run of
the host account.

Also, interpreters like Perl or xlisp usually
contain system() style calls which allow complete
access to the host account.

In general, I recommend that you place
in this directory only programs specifically
written to be run as Muq coprocesses, with
careful attention to security (do you have
any fixed-size buffers which can be over-run
to overwrite code?  Do you use 'gets()'
anywhere?  Can stack over-runs breach
security? ... ) or else allow only trusted
users onto your Muq server.



Note also that coprocess programs need to
disable output buffering to avoid deadlock.
This means doing something like

   select( (select(STDOUT), $| = 1)[0]);

in Perl script coprocesses, or in C doing

   setvbuf( stdout, NULL, _IOLBF, 0 );

if you always write complete lines, else

   setvbuf( stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0 );

to completely disable output buffering.
For other languages, check your manual. :)

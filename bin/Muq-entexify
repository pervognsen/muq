# I'm trying to include all the C source in the online
# HTML documentation, eventually.  I'm doing this by
# basically making the C source files valid texinfo
# files, with the C source in the @example constructs.
#
# When compiling, we just run the C source through
# Muq-detexify to strip out everything but the contents
# of the examples.  
#
# Main problem with that is that I _really_ don't want
# to write @{ ... @} everywhere in the C source in place
# of simply { ...  } -- ick!
#
# So I don't, and instead run the C sourcefiles through
# this little filter before handing them to any of the
# texinfo tools -- the filter converts { } to @{ }@
# within examples.

	# Convert @ to @@:

        s/([^\@])\{/$1\@\{/g;

	# Convert } to @}:
        s/([^\@])\}/$1\@\}/g;

	# Special cases for all of the above at start of line:

        s/^\}/\@\}/g;

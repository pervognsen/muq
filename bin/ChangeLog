	* muq-libs: Changed
            echo "\"Installing library $m\\n\" ,"   >>$our_muq_libs/tmp.t
	to
            echo '"Installing library #n" ,'         >$our_muq_libs/y
	    sed -e "s|#|$m\\\\|" <$our_muq_libs/y   >>$our_muq_libs/tmp.t
	    /bin/rm -f                                $our_muq_libs/y
	because the first wasn't portable to Irix 6.2 and the
	latter was the simplest, most portable replacement I could
	work out.
	
	* Changed
	    #!/bin/sh
	eveywhere to
	    #! /bin/sh
	per autoconfig "Portable Shell" recommendation -- supposedly
	4.2BSD systems need this, because they treat "#! /" as a file
	magic number.

	* muq-std-checkmuf: Tests now run in big batches, instead of
	firing up a server per library.  (Speed optimization.)

	* muq-libs: Libraries now loaded in one or two big batches,
	instead of firing up a server per library. (Speed optimization.)

Mon Nov  6 01:46:22 1995  Jeff Prothero  <jsp@muq.org>

	* muq-config: Added "srvdir" support.

Sun Oct  1 11:42:37 1995  Jeff Prothero  <jsp@muq.org>

	* muq-c-lib: Created, to simplify installing a single file
	in muq/c/vm during development.

Sat Aug  5 11:21:54 1995  Jeff Prothero  <jsp@muq.org>

	* Added a similar check to muq-deconfigure-c-makefile.

	* Added a couple of similar checks to muq-clean.

	* (muq-clean-doc): Following a Pakrat suggestion, added a check
	that $docdir actually exists before attempting to operate on it,
	to avoid "make clean" and such getting upset at missing dirs.

Sat Apr 15 15:15:25 1995  Jeff Prothero  <jsp@muq.org>

	* muq-lib: Fixed: It wasn't checking return status from Muq.
	Return-correct-exit-status fixes in various other files.

Tue Mar 14 17:31:48 1995  Jeff Prothero  <jsp@muq.org>

	* Renamed 'muq-clobber' to 'muq-distclean', which seems more standard.

	* muq-texi2html has been added.  This is texi2html 1.35 with a few
	additional twiddles that I need for Muq (and which I've fed
	back to Lionel Cons for possible inclusion in future releases.)

	* muq-install-htm has been added.

Tue Feb 21 22:34:41 1995  Jeff Prothero  <jsp@muq.org>

	* muq-config: Added 'htmldir' to standard set of directories.

Mon Feb 20 21:35:08 1995  Jeff Prothero  <jsp@muq.org>

	* Renamed info/ to doc/

Sun Nov 13 04:42:35 1994  Jeff Prothero  <jsp@muq.org>

	* Added muq-diff.

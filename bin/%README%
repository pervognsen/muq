                   muq/bin/#README#       last update: 94Jul09

This directory contains all our production executables and
scripts.  It needs to be on your PATH -- see muq/INSTALLATION
for the recommended procedure.

Many of these scripts are used internally by c/Makefile, and not
expected to be invoked directly by the user.  (Which is to say: Do not
feel obligated to know what they all do.)



We prefix the executables in this directory with 'muq' to
avoid conflicts with local and system files.



With odd combinations of NFS mounting and LAN filesystems
and symbolic links and read-only filesystems on CDROM and
such becoming more and more common, I've tried to minimize
assumptions as to which muq directories are where:

I've tried to make Muq-config.sh the only file which knows
where the various directories are; in principle, you should
be able to move any of the directories anywhere you want,
update Muq-config.sh to know where they are, recompile the
server, and everything should continue to work fine.

This is untested, so expect teething problems if you try
this!
